[52] CHAPTER I.[53] I GO TO STYLES[54] [13]
[55] [13]
[56] The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the[57] time as “The Styles Case” has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in[58] view of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked,[59] both by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account[60] of the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the[61] sensational rumours which still persist.[62] [13]
[63] I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my[64] being connected with the affair.[65] [13]
[66] I had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some[67] months in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month’s[68] sick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make[69] up my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen[70] very little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him[71] particularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one[72] thing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though,[73] I had often stayed at Styles, his mother’s place in Essex.[74] [13]
[75] We had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me[76] down to Styles to spend my leave there.[77] [13]
[78] “The mater will be delighted to see you again—after all those years,”[79] he added.[80] [13]
[81] “Your mother keeps well?” I asked.[82] [13]
[83] “Oh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?”[84] [13]
[85] I am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who[86] had married John’s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been[87] a handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could[88] not be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic,[89] autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social[90] notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady[91] Bountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable[92] fortune of her own.[93] [13]
[94] Their country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish[95] early in their married life. He had been completely under his wife’s[96] ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her[97] lifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that[98] was distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however, had[99] always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the[100] time of their father’s remarriage that they always thought of her as[101] their own mother.[102] [13]
[103] Lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a[104] doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at[105] home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any[106] marked success.[107] [13]
[108] John practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled[109] down to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married two[110] years ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I[111] entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother[112] to increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home[113] of his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her[114] own plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this[115] case she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.[116] [13]
[117] John noticed my surprise at the news of his mother’s remarriage and[118] smiled rather ruefully.[119] [13]
[120] “Rotten little bounder too!” he said savagely. “I can tell you,[121] Hastings, it’s making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie—you[122] remember Evie?”[123] [13]
[124] “No.”[125] [13]
[126] “Oh, I suppose she was after your time. She’s the mater’s factotum,[127] companion, Jack of all trades! A great sport—old Evie! Not precisely[128] young and beautiful, but as game as they make them.”[129] [13]
[130] “You were going to say——?”[131] [13]
[132] “Oh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a[133] second cousin or something of Evie’s, though she didn’t seem[134] particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an[135] absolute outsider, anyone can see that. He’s got a great black beard,[136] and wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned[137] to him at once, took him on as secretary—you know how she’s always[138] running a hundred societies?”[139] [13]
[140] I nodded.[141] [13]
[142] “Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No[143] doubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us[144] all down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced[145] that she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty[146] years younger than she is! It’s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but[147] there you are—she is her own mistress, and she’s married him.”[148] [13]
[149] “It must be a difficult situation for you all.”[150] [13]
[151] “Difficult! It’s damnable!”[152] [13]
[153] Thus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train[154] at Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason[155] for existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country[156] lanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out[157] to the car.[158] [13]
[159] “Got a drop or two of petrol still, you see,” he remarked. “Mainly[160] owing to the mater’s activities.”[161] [13]
[162] The village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the[163] little station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It[164] was a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat[165] Essex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it[166] seemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great[167] war was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed[168] into another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:[169] [13]
[170] “I’m afraid you’ll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.”[171] [13]
[172] “My dear fellow, that’s just what I want.”[173] [13]
[174] “Oh, it’s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill[175] with the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife[176] works regularly ‘on the land’. She is up at five every morning to milk,[177] and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It’s a jolly good life taking[178] it all round—if it weren’t for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!” He[179] checked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. “I wonder if we’ve[180] time to pick up Cynthia. No, she’ll have started from the hospital by[181] now.”[182] [13]
[183] “Cynthia! That’s not your wife?”[184] [13]
[185] “No, Cynthia is a protégée of my mother’s, the daughter of an old[186] schoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a[187] cropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came[188] to the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She[189] works in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.”[190] [13]
[191] As he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.[192] A lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,[193] straightened herself at our approach.[194] [13]
[195] “Hullo, Evie, here’s our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings—Miss Howard.”[196] [13]
[197] Miss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had an[198] impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a[199] pleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly[200] in its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with[201] feet to match—these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation,[202] I soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.[203] [13]
[204] “Weeds grow like house afire. Can’t keep even with ’em. Shall press you[205] in. Better be careful.”[206] [13]
[207] “I’m sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,” I[208] responded.[209] [13]
[210] “Don’t say it. Never does. Wish you hadn’t later.”[211] [13]
[212] “You’re a cynic, Evie,” said John, laughing. “Where’s tea to-day—inside[213] or out?”[214] [13]
[215] “Out. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.”[216] [13]
[217] “Come on then, you’ve done enough gardening for to-day. ‘The labourer[218] is worthy of his hire’, you know. Come and be refreshed.”[219] [13]
[220] “Well,” said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, “I’m[221] inclined to agree with you.”[222] [13]
[223] She led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade[224] of a large sycamore.[225] [13]
[226] A figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to[227] meet us.[228] [13]
[229] “My wife, Hastings,” said John.[230] [13]
[231] I shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall,[232] slender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of[233] slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful[234] tawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman’s[235] that I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,[236] which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in[237] an exquisitely civilised body—all these things are burnt into my[238] memory. I shall never forget them.[239] [13]
[240] She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear[241] voice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I[242] had accepted John’s invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and[243] her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a[244] thoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always[245] stimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents[246] of my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly[247] amused my hostess. John, of course, good fellow though he is, could[248] hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.[249] [13]
[250] At that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French[251] window near at hand:[252] [13]
[253] “Then you’ll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I’ll write to[254] Lady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we[255] hear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might[256] open it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there’s the[257] Duchess—about the school fête.”[258] [13]
[259] There was the murmur of a man’s voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp’s rose[260] in reply:[261] [13]
[262] “Yes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful,[263] Alfred dear.”[264] [13]
[265] The French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome[266] white-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features,[267] stepped out of it on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of[268] deference in his manner.[269] [13]
[270] Mrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.[271] [13]
[272] “Why, if it isn’t too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after[273] all these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings—my husband.”[274] [13]
[275] I looked with some curiosity at “Alfred darling”. He certainly struck a[276] rather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard. It[277] was one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore[278] gold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It[279] struck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out[280] of place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He[281] placed a wooden hand in mine and said:[282] [13]
[283] “This is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings.” Then, turning to his wife: “Emily[284] dearest, I think that cushion is a little damp.”[285] [13]
[286] She beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every[287] demonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an[288] otherwise sensible woman![289] [13]
[290] With the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled[291] hostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in[292] particular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp,[293] however, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I[294] remembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she[295] poured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the[296] forthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place[297] shortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of[298] days or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the[299] very first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter[300] myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.[301] [13]
[302] Presently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about[303] letters to Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his[304] painstaking voice:[305] [13]
[306] “Is soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?”[307] [13]
[308] “No, before the war I was in Lloyd’s.”[309] [13]
[310] “And you will return there after it is over?”[311] [13]
[312] “Perhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.”[313] [13]
[314] Mary Cavendish leant forward.[315] [13]
[316] “What would you really choose as a profession, if you could just[317] consult your inclination?”[318] [13]
[319] “Well, that depends.”[320] [13]
[321] “No secret hobby?” she asked. “Tell me—you’re drawn to something?[322] Everyone is—usually something absurd.”[323] [13]
[324] “You’ll laugh at me.”[325] [13]
[326] She smiled.[327] [13]
[328] “Perhaps.”[329] [13]
[330] “Well, I’ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!”[331] [13]
[332] “The real thing—Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?”[333] [13]
[334] “Oh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully[335] drawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous[336] detective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow.[337] He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of[338] method. My system is based on his—though of course I have progressed[339] rather further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but[340] wonderfully clever.”[341] [13]
[342] “Like a good detective story myself,” remarked Miss Howard. “Lots of[343] nonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Everyone[344] dumbfounded. Real crime—you’d know at once.”[345] [13]
[346] “There have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,” I argued.[347] [13]
[348] “Don’t mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The[349] family. You couldn’t really hoodwink them. They’d know.”[350] [13]
[351] “Then,” I said, much amused, “you think that if you were mixed up in a[352] crime, say a murder, you’d be able to spot the murderer right off?”[353] [13]
[354] “Of course I should. Mightn’t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.[355] But I’m certain I’d know. I’d feel it in my fingertips if he came near[356] me.”[357] [13]
[358] “It might be a ‘she’,” I suggested.[359] [13]
[360] “Might. But murder’s a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.”[361] [13]
[362] “Not in a case of poisoning.” Mrs. Cavendish’s clear voice startled me.[363] “Dr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general[364] ignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,[365] there were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.”[366] [13]
[367] “Why, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!” cried Mrs. Inglethorp. “It[368] makes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there’s[369] Cynthia!”[370] [13]
[371] A young girl in V.A.D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.[372] [13]
[373] “Why, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings—Miss Murdoch.”[374] [13]
[375] Cynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and[376] vigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D. cap, and I admired the great[377] loose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the[378] hand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she[379] would have been a beauty.[380] [13]
[381] She flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a[382] plate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.[383] [13]
[384] “Sit down here on the grass, do. It’s ever so much nicer.”[385] [13]
[386] I dropped down obediently.[387] [13]
[388] “You work at Tadminster, don’t you, Miss Murdoch?”[389] [13]
[390] She nodded.[391] [13]
[392] “For my sins.”[393] [13]
[394] “Do they bully you, then?” I asked, smiling.[395] [13]
[396] “I should like to see them!” cried Cynthia with dignity.[397] [13]
[398] “I have got a cousin who is nursing,” I remarked. “And she is terrified[399] of ‘Sisters’.”[400] [13]
[401] “I don’t wonder. Sisters _are_, you know, Mr. Hastings. They simp-ly[402] _are_! You’ve no idea! But I’m not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the[403] dispensary.”[404] [13]
[405] “How many people do you poison?” I asked, smiling.[406] [13]
[407] Cynthia smiled too.[408] [13]
[409] “Oh, hundreds!” she said.[410] [13]
[411] “Cynthia,” called Mrs. Inglethorp, “do you think you could write a few[412] notes for me?”[413] [13]
[414] “Certainly, Aunt Emily.”[415] [13]
[416] She jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that[417] her position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as she[418] might be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.[419] [13]
[420] My hostess turned to me.[421] [13]
[422] “John will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have[423] given up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member’s[424] wife—she was the late Lord Abbotsbury’s daughter—does the same. She[425] agrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a[426] war household; nothing is wasted here—every scrap of waste paper, even,[427] is saved and sent away in sacks.”[428] [13]
[429] I expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the[430] broad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different[431] wings of the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out[432] over the park.[433] [13]
[434] John left me, and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking[435] slowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch. I heard Mrs.[436] Inglethorp call “Cynthia” impatiently, and the girl started and ran[437] back to the house. At the same moment, a man stepped out from the[438] shadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked[439] about forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some[440] violent emotion seemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window[441] as he passed, and I recognized him, though he had changed much in the[442] fifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. It was John’s younger[443] brother, Lawrence Cavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought[444] that singular expression to his face.[445] [13]
[446] Then I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of[447] my own affairs.[448] [13]
[449] The evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that[450] enigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish.[451] [13]
[452] The next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of the[453] anticipation of a delightful visit.[454] [13]
[455] I did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to[456] take me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the[457] woods, returning to the house about five.[458] [13]
[459] As we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into the[460] smoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had[461] occurred. We followed him in, and he shut the door after us.[462] [13]
[463] “Look here, Mary, there’s the deuce of a mess. Evie’s had a row with[464] Alfred Inglethorp, and she’s off.”[465] [13]
[466] “Evie? Off?”[467] [13]
[468] John nodded gloomily.[469] [13]
[470] “Yes; you see she went to the mater, and—Oh,—here’s Evie herself.”[471] [13]
[472] Miss Howard entered. Her lips were set grimly together, and she carried[473] a small suit-case. She looked excited and determined, and slightly on[474] the defensive.[475] [13]
[476] “At any rate,” she burst out, “I’ve spoken my mind!”[477] [13]
[478] “My dear Evelyn,” cried Mrs. Cavendish, “this can’t be true!”[479] [13]
[480] Miss Howard nodded grimly.[481] [13]
[482] “True enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she won’t forget or[483] forgive in a hurry. Don’t mind if they’ve only sunk in a bit. Probably[484] water off a duck’s back, though. I said right out: ‘You’re an old[485] woman, Emily, and there’s no fool like an old fool. The man’s twenty[486] years younger than you, and don’t you fool yourself as to what he[487] married you for. Money! Well, don’t let him have too much of it. Farmer[488] Raikes has got a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much[489] time he spends over there.’ She was very angry. Natural! I went on,[490] ‘I’m going to warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as[491] soon murder you in your bed as look at you. He’s a bad lot. You can say[492] what you like to me, but remember what I’ve told you. He’s a bad lot!’”[493] [13]
[494] “What did she say?”[495] [13]
[496] Miss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace.[497] [13]
[498] “‘Darling Alfred’—‘dearest Alfred’—‘wicked calumnies’ —‘wicked[499] lies’—‘wicked woman’—to accuse her ‘dear husband!’ The sooner I left[500] her house the better. So I’m off.”[501] [13]
[502] “But not now?”[503] [13]
[504] “This minute!”[505] [13]
[506] For a moment we sat and stared at her. Finally John Cavendish, finding[507] his persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. His wife[508] followed him, murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp to[509] think better of it.[510] [13]
[511] As she left the room, Miss Howard’s face changed. She leant towards me[512] eagerly.[513] [13]
[514] “Mr. Hastings, you’re honest. I can trust you?”[515] [13]
[516] I was a little startled. She laid her hand on my arm, and sank her[517] voice to a whisper.[518] [13]
[519] “Look after her, Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. They’re a lot of[520] sharks—all of them. Oh, I know what I’m talking about. There isn’t one[521] of them that’s not hard up and trying to get money out of her. I’ve[522] protected her as much as I could. Now I’m out of the way, they’ll[523] impose upon her.”[524] [13]
[525] “Of course, Miss Howard,” I said, “I’ll do everything I can, but I’m[526] sure you’re excited and overwrought.”[527] [13]
[528] She interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.[529] [13]
[530] “Young man, trust me. I’ve lived in the world rather longer than you[531] have. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. You’ll see what I mean.”[532] [13]
[533] The throb of the motor came through the open window, and Miss Howard[534] rose and moved to the door. John’s voice sounded outside. With her hand[535] on the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to[536] me.[537] [13]
[538] “Above all, Mr. Hastings, watch that devil—her husband!”[539] [13]
[540] There was no time for more. Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager[541] chorus of protests and good-byes. The Inglethorps did not appear.[542] [13]
[543] As the motor drove away, Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself from[544] the group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall[545] bearded man who had been evidently making for the house. The colour[546] rose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him.[547] [13]
[548] “Who is that?” I asked sharply, for instinctively I distrusted the man.[549] [13]
[550] “That’s Dr. Bauerstein,” said John shortly.[551] [13]
[552] “And who is Dr. Bauerstein?”[553] [13]
[554] “He’s staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous[555] breakdown. He’s a London specialist; a very clever man—one of the[556] greatest living experts on poisons, I believe.”[557] [13]
[558] “And he’s a great friend of Mary’s,” put in Cynthia, the irrepressible.[559] [13]
[560] John Cavendish frowned and changed the subject.[561] [13]
[562] “Come for a stroll, Hastings. This has been a most rotten business. She[563] always had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in England[564] than Evelyn Howard.”[565] [13]
[566] He took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to the[567] village through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.[568] [13]
[569] As we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty[570] young woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and[571] smiled.[572] [13]
[573] “That’s a pretty girl,” I remarked appreciatively.[574] [13]
[575] John’s face hardened.[576] [13]
[577] “That is Mrs. Raikes.”[578] [13]
[579] “The one that Miss Howard——”[580] [13]
[581] “Exactly,” said John, with rather unnecessary abruptness.[582] [13]
[583] I thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid[584] wicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of[585] foreboding crept over me. I brushed it aside.[586] [13]
[587] “Styles is really a glorious old place,” I said to John.[588] [13]
[589] He nodded rather gloomily.[590] [13]
[591] “Yes, it’s a fine property. It’ll be mine some day—should be mine now[592] by rights, if my father had only made a decent will. And then I[593] shouldn’t be so damned hard up as I am now.”[594] [13]
[595] “Hard up, are you?”[596] [13]
[597] “My dear Hastings, I don’t mind telling you that I’m at my wits’ end[598] for money.”[599] [13]
[600] “Couldn’t your brother help you?”[601] [13]
[602] “Lawrence? He’s gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten[603] verses in fancy bindings. No, we’re an impecunious lot. My mother’s[604] always been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now. Since[605] her marriage, of course——” he broke off, frowning.[606] [13]
[607] For the first time I felt that, with Evelyn Howard, something[608] indefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt[609] security. Now that security was removed—and the air seemed rife with[610] suspicion. The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me[611] unpleasantly. A vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my[612] mind. Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil.[613] [13]
[614] [13]
[615] [13]
[616] [13]
[617] CHAPTER II.[618] THE 16TH AND 17TH OF JULY[619] [13]
[620] [13]
[621] I had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July. I come now to the events of[622] the 16th and 17th of that month. For the convenience of the reader I[623] will recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as[624] possible. They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of[625] long and tedious cross-examinations.[626] [13]
[627] I received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her[628] departure, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in[629] Middlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging[630] me to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be[631] reconciled.[632] [13]
[633] The only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendish’s[634] extraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the[635] society of Dr. Bauerstein. What she saw in the man I cannot imagine,[636] but she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for[637] long expeditions with him. I must confess that I was quite unable to[638] see his attraction.[639] [13]
[640] The 16th of July fell on a Monday. It was a day of turmoil. The famous[641] bazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connection[642] with the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War[643] poem, was to be held that night. We were all busy during the morning[644] arranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take[645] place. We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the[646] garden. I noticed that John’s manner was somewhat unusual. He seemed[647] very excited and restless.[648] [13]
[649] After tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts[650] in the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis.[651] [13]
[652] About a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be[653] late as supper was early that night. We had rather a scramble to get[654] ready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at[655] the door.[656] [13]
[657] The entertainment was a great success, Mrs. Inglethorp’s recitation[658] receiving tremendous applause. There were also some tableaux in which[659] Cynthia took part. She did not return with us, having been asked to a[660] supper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been[661] acting with her in the tableaux.[662] [13]
[663] The following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as[664] she was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about[665] 12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.[666] [13]
[667] “Such a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston. Lady Tadminster’s[668] sister, you know. The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror—one of[669] our oldest families.”[670] [13]
[671] Mary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr.[672] Bauerstein.[673] [13]
[674] We had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested[675] that we should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our[676] way, and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary. Mrs. Inglethorp[677] replied that this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters[678] to write she would drop us there, and we could come back with Cynthia[679] in the pony-trap.[680] [13]
[681] We were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia[682] appeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white[683] overall. She took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow[684] dispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerily[685] addressed as “Nibs.”[686] [13]
[687] “What a lot of bottles!” I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the[688] small room. “Do you really know what’s in them all?”[689] [13]
[690] “Say something original,” groaned Cynthia. “Every single person who[691] comes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on[692] the first individual who does _not_ say: ‘What a lot of bottles!’ And I[693] know the next thing you’re going to say is: ‘How many people have you[694] poisoned?’”[695] [13]
[696] I pleaded guilty with a laugh.[697] [13]
[698] “If you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by[699] mistake, you wouldn’t joke about it. Come on, let’s have tea. We’ve got[700] all sorts of secret stores in that cupboard. No, Lawrence—that’s the[701] poison cupboard. The big cupboard—that’s right.”[702] [13]
[703] We had a very cheery tea, and assisted Cynthia to wash up afterwards.[704] We had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door.[705] The countenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a[706] stern and forbidding expression.[707] [13]
[708] “Come in,” said Cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.[709] [13]
[710] A young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which[711] she proffered to Nibs, who waved her towards Cynthia with the somewhat[712] enigmatical remark:[713] [13]
[714] “_I_’m not really here to-day.”[715] [13]
[716] Cynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.[717] [13]
[718] “This should have been sent up this morning.”[719] [13]
[720] “Sister is very sorry. She forgot.”[721] [13]
[722] “Sister should read the rules outside the door.”[723] [13]
[724] I gathered from the little nurse’s expression that there was not the[725] least likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to[726] the dreaded “Sister”.[727] [13]
[728] “So now it can’t be done until to-morrow,” finished Cynthia.[729] [13]
[730] “Don’t you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?”[731] [13]
[732] “Well,” said Cynthia graciously, “we are very busy, but if we have time[733] it shall be done.”[734] [13]
[735] The little nurse withdrew, and Cynthia promptly took a jar from the[736] shelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the[737] door.[738] [13]
[739] I laughed.[740] [13]
[741] “Discipline must be maintained?”[742] [13]
[743] “Exactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outside[744] wards there.”[745] [13]
[746] I followed Cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different[747] wards to me. Lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments Cynthia[748] called to him over her shoulder to come and join us. Then she looked at[749] her watch.[750] [13]
[751] “Nothing more to do, Nibs?”[752] [13]
[753] “No.”[754] [13]
[755] “All right. Then we can lock up and go.”[756] [13]
[757] I had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. Compared[758] to John, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. He was[759] the opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually[760] shy and reserved. Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied[761] that, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for[762] him. I had always fancied that his manner to Cynthia was rather[763] constrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him.[764] But they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like[765] a couple of children.[766] [13]
[767] As we drove through the village, I remembered that I wanted some[768] stamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office.[769] [13]
[770] As I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just[771] entering. I drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud[772] exclamation, he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.[773] [13]
[774] “_Mon ami_ Hastings!” he cried. “It is indeed _mon ami_ Hastings!”[775] [13]
[776] “Poirot!” I exclaimed.[777] [13]
[778] I turned to the pony-trap.[779] [13]
[780] “This is a very pleasant meeting for me, Miss Cynthia. This is my old[781] friend, Monsieur Poirot, whom I have not seen for years.”[782] [13]
[783] “Oh, we know Monsieur Poirot,” said Cynthia gaily. “But I had no idea[784] he was a friend of yours.”[785] [13]
[786] “Yes, indeed,” said Poirot seriously. “I know Mademoiselle Cynthia. It[787] is by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.” Then,[788] as I looked at him inquiringly: “Yes, my friend, she had kindly[789] extended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are[790] refugees from their native land. We Belgians will always remember her[791] with gratitude.”[792] [13]
[793] Poirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more than[794] five feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His[795] head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little[796] on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of[797] his attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have[798] caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified[799] little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his[800] time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. As a[801] detective, his _flair_ had been extraordinary, and he had achieved[802] triumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.[803] [13]
[804] He pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow[805] Belgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date. Then he[806] raised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away.[807] [13]
[808] “He’s a dear little man,” said Cynthia. “I’d no idea you knew him.”[809] [13]
[810] “You’ve been entertaining a celebrity unawares,” I replied.[811] [13]
[812] And, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the various[813] exploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot.[814] [13]
[815] We arrived back in a very cheerful mood. As we entered the hall, Mrs.[816] Inglethorp came out of her boudoir. She looked flushed and upset.[817] [13]
[818] “Oh, it’s you,” she said.[819] [13]
[820] “Is there anything the matter, Aunt Emily?” asked Cynthia.[821] [13]
[822] “Certainly not,” said Mrs. Inglethorp sharply. “What should there be?”[823] Then catching sight of Dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the[824] dining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.[825] [13]
[826] “Yes, m’m.” The old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: “Don’t[827] you think, m’m, you’d better get to bed? You’re looking very tired.”[828] [13]
[829] “Perhaps you’re right, Dorcas—yes—no—not now. I’ve some letters I must[830] finish by post-time. Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told[831] you?”[832] [13]
[833] “Yes, m’m.”[834] [13]
[835] “Then I’ll go to bed directly after supper.”[836] [13]
[837] She went into the boudoir again, and Cynthia stared after her.[838] [13]
[839] “Goodness gracious! I wonder what’s up?” she said to Lawrence.[840] [13]
[841] He did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his[842] heel and went out of the house.[843] [13]
[844] I suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, Cynthia agreeing,[845] I ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.[846] [13]
[847] Mrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs. It may have been my fancy,[848] but she, too, was looking odd and disturbed.[849] [13]
[850] “Had a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein?” I asked, trying to appear as[851] indifferent as I could.[852] [13]
[853] “I didn’t go,” she replied abruptly. “Where is Mrs. Inglethorp?”[854] [13]
[855] “In the boudoir.”[856] [13]
[857] Her hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerve[858] herself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs[859] across the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her.[860] [13]
[861] As I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, I had to pass the[862] open boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following[863] scrap of dialogue. Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman[864] desperately controlling herself:[865] [13]
[866] “Then you won’t show it to me?”[867] [13]
[868] To which Mrs. Inglethorp replied:[869] [13]
[870] “My dear Mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.”[871] [13]
[872] “Then show it to me.”[873] [13]
[874] “I tell you it is not what you imagine. It does not concern you in the[875] least.”[876] [13]
[877] To which Mary Cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:[878] [13]
[879] “Of course, I might have known you would shield him.”[880] [13]
[881] Cynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with:[882] [13]
[883] “I say! There’s been the most awful row! I’ve got it all out of[884] Dorcas.”[885] [13]
[886] “What kind of a row?”[887] [13]
[888] “Between Aunt Emily and _him_. I do hope she’s found him out at last!”[889] [13]
[890] “Was Dorcas there, then?”[891] [13]
[892] “Of course not. She ‘happened to be near the door’. It was a real old[893] bust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about.”[894] [13]
[895] I thought of Mrs. Raikes’s gipsy face, and Evelyn Howard’s warnings,[896] but wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every[897] possible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, “Aunt Emily will send him[898] away, and will never speak to him again.”[899] [13]
[900] I was anxious to get hold of John, but he was nowhere to be seen.[901] Evidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I tried[902] to forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could[903] not dismiss them altogether from my mind. What was Mary Cavendish’s[904] concern in the matter?[905] [13]
[906] Mr. Inglethorp was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper. His[907] face was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck[908] me afresh.[909] [13]
[910] Mrs. Inglethorp came down last. She still looked agitated, and during[911] the meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. Inglethorp was[912] unusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with little[913] attentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the[914] part of the devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorp[915] retired to her boudoir again.[916] [13]
[917] “Send my coffee in here, Mary,” she called. “I’ve just five minutes to[918] catch the post.”[919] [13]
[920] Cynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. Mary[921] Cavendish brought our coffee to us. She seemed excited.[922] [13]
[923] “Do you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?” she[924] asked. “Will you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee, Cynthia? I will pour[925] it out.”[926] [13]
[927] “Do not trouble, Mary,” said Inglethorp. “I will take it to Emily.” He[928] poured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully.[929] [13]
[930] Lawrence followed him, and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us.[931] [13]
[932] We three sat for some time in silence. It was a glorious night, hot and[933] still. Mrs. Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf.[934] [13]
[935] “It’s almost too hot,” she murmured. “We shall have a thunderstorm.”[936] [13]
[937] Alas, that these harmonious moments can never endure! My paradise was[938] rudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked,[939] voice in the hall.[940] [13]
[941] “Dr. Bauerstein!” exclaimed Cynthia. “What a funny time to come.”[942] [13]
[943] I glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish, but she seemed quite[944] undisturbed, the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.[945] [13]
[946] In a few moments, Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the[947] latter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for a[948] drawing-room. In truth, he presented a sorry spectacle, being literally[949] plastered with mud.[950] [13]
[951] “What have you been doing, doctor?” cried Mrs. Cavendish.[952] [13]
[953] “I must make my apologies,” said the doctor. “I did not really mean to[954] come in, but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.”[955] [13]
[956] “Well, Bauerstein, you are in a plight,” said John, strolling in from[957] the hall. “Have some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.”[958] [13]
[959] “Thank you, I will.” He laughed rather ruefully, as he described how he[960] had discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place,[961] and in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing, and slipped[962] ignominiously into a neighbouring pond.[963] [13]
[964] “The sun soon dried me off,” he added, “but I’m afraid my appearance is[965] very disreputable.”[966] [13]
[967] At this juncture, Mrs. Inglethorp called to Cynthia from the hall, and[968] the girl ran out.[969] [13]
[970] “Just carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear? I’m going to bed.”[971] [13]
[972] The door into the hall was a wide one. I had risen when Cynthia did,[973] John was close by me. There were therefore three witnesses who could[974] swear that Mrs. Inglethorp was carrying her coffee, as yet untasted, in[975] her hand.[976] [13]
[977] My evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr.[978] Bauerstein. It seemed to me the man would never go. He rose at last,[979] however, and I breathed a sigh of relief.[980] [13]
[981] “I’ll walk down to the village with you,” said Mr. Inglethorp. “I must[982] see our agent over those estate accounts.” He turned to John. “No one[983] need sit up. I will take the latch-key.”[984] [13]
[985] [13]
[986] [13]
[987] [13]
[988] CHAPTER III.[989] THE NIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY[990] [13]
[991] [13]
[992] To make this part of my story clear, I append the following plan of the[993] first floor of Styles. The servants’ rooms are reached through the door[994] B. They have no communication with the right wing, where the[995] Inglethorps’ rooms were situated.[996] [13]
[997] [Illustration][998] [13]
[999] It seemed to be the middle of the night when I was awakened by Lawrence[1000] Cavendish. He had a candle in his hand, and the agitation of his face[1001] told me at once that something was seriously wrong.[1002] [13]
[1003] “What’s the matter?” I asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect[1004] my scattered thoughts.[1005] [13]
[1006] “We are afraid my mother is very ill. She seems to be having some kind[1007] of fit. Unfortunately she has locked herself in.”[1008] [13]
[1009] “I’ll come at once.”[1010] [13]
[1011] I sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed Lawrence[1012] along the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house.[1013] [13]
[1014] John Cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing[1015] round in a state of awe-stricken excitement. Lawrence turned to his[1016] brother.[1017] [13]
[1018] “What do you think we had better do?”[1019] [13]
[1020] Never, I thought, had his indecision of character been more apparent.[1021] [13]
[1022] John rattled the handle of Mrs. Inglethorp’s door violently, but with[1023] no effect. It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside. The whole[1024] household was aroused by now. The most alarming sounds were audible[1025] from the interior of the room. Clearly something must be done.[1026] [13]
[1027] “Try going through Mr. Inglethorp’s room, sir,” cried Dorcas. “Oh, the[1028] poor mistress!”[1029] [13]
[1030] Suddenly I realized that Alfred Inglethorp was not with us—that he[1031] alone had given no sign of his presence. John opened the door of his[1032] room. It was pitch dark, but Lawrence was following with the candle,[1033] and by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and[1034] that there was no sign of the room having been occupied.[1035] [13]
[1036] We went straight to the connecting door. That, too, was locked or[1037] bolted on the inside. What was to be done?[1038] [13]
[1039] “Oh, dear, sir,” cried Dorcas, wringing her hands, “what ever shall we[1040] do?”[1041] [13]
[1042] “We must try and break the door in, I suppose. It’ll be a tough job,[1043] though. Here, let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him[1044] to go for Dr. Wilkins at once. Now then, we’ll have a try at the door.[1045] Half a moment, though, isn’t there a door into Miss Cynthia’s rooms?”[1046] [13]
[1047] “Yes, sir, but that’s always bolted. It’s never been undone.”[1048] [13]
[1049] “Well, we might just see.”[1050] [13]
[1051] He ran rapidly down the corridor to Cynthia’s room. Mary Cavendish was[1052] there, shaking the girl—who must have been an unusually sound[1053] sleeper—and trying to wake her.[1054] [13]
[1055] In a moment or two he was back.[1056] [13]
[1057] “No good. That’s bolted too. We must break in the door. I think this[1058] one is a shade less solid than the one in the passage.”[1059] [13]
[1060] We strained and heaved together. The framework of the door was solid,[1061] and for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it[1062] give beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was[1063] burst open.[1064] [13]
[1065] We stumbled in together, Lawrence still holding his candle. Mrs.[1066] Inglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent[1067] convulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside[1068] her. As we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon[1069] the pillows.[1070] [13]
[1071] John strode across the room, and lit the gas. Turning to Annie, one of[1072] the housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy.[1073] Then he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave[1074] on the corridor.[1075] [13]
[1076] I turned to Lawrence, to suggest that I had better leave them now that[1077] there was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on[1078] my lips. Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man’s face. He[1079] was white as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was[1080] sputtering onto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or[1081] some such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on[1082] the further wall. It was as though he had seen something that turned[1083] him to stone. I instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but I[1084] could see nothing unusual. The still feebly flickering ashes in the[1085] grate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely[1086] harmless enough.[1087] [13]
[1088] The violence of Mrs. Inglethorp’s attack seemed to be passing. She was[1089] able to speak in short gasps.[1090] [13]
[1091] “Better now—very sudden—stupid of me—to lock myself in.”[1092] [13]
[1093] A shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, I saw Mary Cavendish standing[1094] near the door with her arm around Cynthia. She seemed to be supporting[1095] the girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself. Her face was[1096] heavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly.[1097] [13]
[1098] “Poor Cynthia is quite frightened,” said Mrs. Cavendish in a low clear[1099] voice. She herself, I noticed, was dressed in her white land smock.[1100] Then it must be later than I thought. I saw that a faint streak of[1101] daylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the[1102] clock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o’clock.[1103] [13]
[1104] A strangled cry from the bed startled me. A fresh access of pain seized[1105] the unfortunate old lady. The convulsions were of a violence terrible[1106] to behold. Everything was confusion. We thronged round her, powerless[1107] to help or alleviate. A final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until[1108] she appeared to rest upon her head and her heels, with her body arched[1109] in an extraordinary manner. In vain Mary and John tried to administer[1110] more brandy. The moments flew. Again the body arched itself in that[1111] peculiar fashion.[1112] [13]
[1113] At that moment, Dr. Bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the[1114] room. For one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure on the[1115] bed, and, at the same instant, Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled[1116] voice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:[1117] [13]
[1118] “Alfred—Alfred——” Then she fell back motionless on the pillows.[1119] [13]
[1120] With a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her arms worked[1121] them energetically, applying what I knew to be artificial respiration.[1122] He issued a few short sharp orders to the servants. An imperious wave[1123] of his hand drove us all to the door. We watched him, fascinated,[1124] though I think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that[1125] nothing could be done now. I could see by the expression on his face[1126] that he himself had little hope.[1127] [13]
[1128] Finally he abandoned his task, shaking his head gravely. At that[1129] moment, we heard footsteps outside, and Dr. Wilkins, Mrs. Inglethorp’s[1130] own doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in.[1131] [13]
[1132] In a few words Dr. Bauerstein explained how he had happened to be[1133] passing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the[1134] house as fast as he could, whilst the car went on to fetch Dr. Wilkins.[1135] With a faint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed.[1136] [13]
[1137] “Ve—ry sad. Ve—ry sad,” murmured Dr. Wilkins. “Poor dear lady. Always[1138] did far too much—far too much—against my advice. I warned her. Her[1139] heart was far from strong. ‘Take it easy,’ I said to her,[1140] ‘Take—it—easy’. But no—her zeal for good works was too great. Nature[1141] rebelled. Na—ture—re—belled.”[1142] [13]
[1143] Dr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly. He[1144] still kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke.[1145] [13]
[1146] “The convulsions were of a peculiar violence, Dr. Wilkins. I am sorry[1147] you were not here in time to witness them. They were quite—tetanic in[1148] character.”[1149] [13]
[1150] “Ah!” said Dr. Wilkins wisely.[1151] [13]
[1152] “I should like to speak to you in private,” said Dr. Bauerstein. He[1153] turned to John. “You do not object?”[1154] [13]
[1155] “Certainly not.”[1156] [13]
[1157] We all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone,[1158] and I heard the key turned in the lock behind us.[1159] [13]
[1160] We went slowly down the stairs. I was violently excited. I have a[1161] certain talent for deduction, and Dr. Bauerstein’s manner had started a[1162] flock of wild surmises in my mind. Mary Cavendish laid her hand upon my[1163] arm.[1164] [13]
[1165] “What is it? Why did Dr. Bauerstein seem so—peculiar?”[1166] [13]
[1167] I looked at her.[1168] [13]
[1169] “Do you know what I think?”[1170] [13]
[1171] “What?”[1172] [13]
[1173] “Listen!” I looked round, the others were out of earshot. I lowered my[1174] voice to a whisper. “I believe she has been poisoned! I’m certain Dr.[1175] Bauerstein suspects it.”[1176] [13]
[1177] “_What?_” She shrank against the wall, the pupils of her eyes dilating[1178] wildly. Then, with a sudden cry that startled me, she cried out: “No,[1179] no—not that—not that!” And breaking from me, fled up the stairs. I[1180] followed her, afraid that she was going to faint. I found her leaning[1181] against the bannisters, deadly pale. She waved me away impatiently.[1182] [13]
[1183] “No, no—leave me. I’d rather be alone. Let me just be quiet for a[1184] minute or two. Go down to the others.”[1185] [13]
[1186] I obeyed her reluctantly. John and Lawrence were in the dining-room. I[1187] joined them. We were all silent, but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of[1188] us all when I at last broke it by saying:[1189] [13]
[1190] “Where is Mr. Inglethorp?”[1191] [13]
[1192] John shook his head.[1193] [13]
[1194] “He’s not in the house.”[1195] [13]
[1196] Our eyes met. Where _was_ Alfred Inglethorp? His absence was strange[1197] and inexplicable. I remembered Mrs. Inglethorp’s dying words. What lay[1198] beneath them? What more could she have told us, if she had had time?[1199] [13]
[1200] At last we heard the doctors descending the stairs. Dr. Wilkins was[1201] looking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward[1202] exultation under a manner of decorous calm. Dr. Bauerstein remained in[1203] the background, his grave bearded face unchanged. Dr. Wilkins was the[1204] spokesman for the two. He addressed himself to John:[1205] [13]
[1206] “Mr. Cavendish, I should like your consent to a post-mortem.”[1207] [13]
[1208] “Is that necessary?” asked John gravely. A spasm of pain crossed his[1209] face.[1210] [13]
[1211] “Absolutely,” said Dr. Bauerstein.[1212] [13]
[1213] “You mean by that——?”[1214] [13]
[1215] “That neither Dr. Wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate[1216] under the circumstances.”[1217] [13]
[1218] John bent his head.[1219] [13]
[1220] “In that case, I have no alternative but to agree.”[1221] [13]
[1222] “Thank you,” said Dr. Wilkins briskly. “We propose that it should take[1223] place to-morrow night—or rather to-night.” And he glanced at the[1224] daylight. “Under the circumstances, I am afraid an inquest can hardly[1225] be avoided—these formalities are necessary, but I beg that you won’t[1226] distress yourselves.”[1227] [13]
[1228] There was a pause, and then Dr. Bauerstein drew two keys from his[1229] pocket, and handed them to John.[1230] [13]
[1231] “These are the keys of the two rooms. I have locked them and, in my[1232] opinion, they would be better kept locked for the present.”[1233] [13]
[1234] The doctors then departed.[1235] [13]
[1236] I had been turning over an idea in my head, and I felt that the moment[1237] had now come to broach it. Yet I was a little chary of doing so. John,[1238] I knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing[1239] optimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. It might be[1240] difficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. Lawrence, on the[1241] other hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, I[1242] felt I might count upon as an ally. There was no doubt that the moment[1243] had come for me to take the lead.[1244] [13]
[1245] “John,” I said, “I am going to ask you something.”[1246] [13]
[1247] “Well?”[1248] [13]
[1249] “You remember my speaking of my friend Poirot? The Belgian who is here?[1250] He has been a most famous detective.”[1251] [13]
[1252] “Yes.”[1253] [13]
[1254] “I want you to let me call him in—to investigate this matter.”[1255] [13]
[1256] “What—now? Before the post-mortem?”[1257] [13]
[1258] “Yes, time is an advantage if—if—there has been foul play.”[1259] [13]
[1260] “Rubbish!” cried Lawrence angrily. “In my opinion the whole thing is a[1261] mare’s nest of Bauerstein’s! Wilkins hadn’t an idea of such a thing,[1262] until Bauerstein put it into his head. But, like all specialists,[1263] Bauerstein’s got a bee in his bonnet. Poisons are his hobby, so of[1264] course he sees them everywhere.”[1265] [13]
[1266] I confess that I was surprised by Lawrence’s attitude. He was so seldom[1267] vehement about anything.[1268] [13]
[1269] John hesitated.[1270] [13]
[1271] “I can’t feel as you do, Lawrence,” he said at last. “I’m inclined to[1272] give Hastings a free hand, though I should prefer to wait a bit. We[1273] don’t want any unnecessary scandal.”[1274] [13]
[1275] “No, no,” I cried eagerly, “you need have no fear of that. Poirot is[1276] discretion itself.”[1277] [13]
[1278] “Very well, then, have it your own way. I leave it in your hands.[1279] Though, if it is as we suspect, it seems a clear enough case. God[1280] forgive me if I am wronging him!”[1281] [13]
[1282] I looked at my watch. It was six o’clock. I determined to lose no time.[1283] [13]
[1284] Five minutes’ delay, however, I allowed myself. I spent it in[1285] ransacking the library until I discovered a medical book which gave a[1286] description of strychnine poisoning.[1287] [13]
[1288] [13]
[1289] [13]
[1290] [13]
[1291] CHAPTER IV.[1292] POIROT INVESTIGATES[1293] [13]
[1294] [13]
[1295] The house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to[1296] the park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through the[1297] long grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I,[1298] accordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my[1299] attention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me.[1300] It was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he been? How did he intend to explain[1301] his absence?[1302] [13]
[1303] He accosted me eagerly.[1304] [13]
[1305] “My God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just heard.”[1306] [13]
[1307] “Where have you been?” I asked.[1308] [13]
[1309] “Denby kept me late last night. It was one o’clock before we’d[1310] finished. Then I found that I’d forgotten the latch-key after all. I[1311] didn’t want to arouse the household, so Denby gave me a bed.”[1312] [13]
[1313] “How did you hear the news?” I asked.[1314] [13]
[1315] “Wilkins knocked Denby up to tell him. My poor Emily! She was so[1316] self-sacrificing—such a noble character. She over-taxed her strength.”[1317] [13]
[1318] A wave of revulsion swept over me. What a consummate hypocrite the man[1319] was![1320] [13]
[1321] “I must hurry on,” I said, thankful that he did not ask me whither I[1322] was bound.[1323] [13]
[1324] In a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways Cottage.[1325] [13]
[1326] Getting no answer, I repeated my summons impatiently. A window above me[1327] was cautiously opened, and Poirot himself looked out.[1328] [13]
[1329] He gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. In a few brief words,[1330] I explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that I wanted his help.[1331] [13]
[1332] “Wait, my friend, I will let you in, and you shall recount to me the[1333] affair whilst I dress.”[1334] [13]
[1335] In a few moments he had unbarred the door, and I followed him up to his[1336] room. There he installed me in a chair, and I related the whole story,[1337] keeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however[1338] insignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.[1339] [13]
[1340] I told him of my awakening, of Mrs. Inglethorp’s dying words, of her[1341] husband’s absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of[1342] conversation between Mary and her mother-in-law that I had overheard,[1343] of the former quarrel between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard, and of[1344] the latter’s innuendoes.[1345] [13]
[1346] I was hardly as clear as I could wish. I repeated myself several times,[1347] and occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten.[1348] Poirot smiled kindly on me.[1349] [13]
[1350] “The mind is confused? Is it not so? Take time, _mon ami_. You are[1351] agitated; you are excited—it is but natural. Presently, when we are[1352] calmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper place. We[1353] will examine—and reject. Those of importance we will put on one side;[1354] those of no importance, pouf!”—he screwed up his cherub-like face, and[1355] puffed comically enough—“blow them away!”[1356] [13]
[1357] “That’s all very well,” I objected, “but how are you going to decide[1358] what is important, and what isn’t? That always seems the difficulty to[1359] me.”[1360] [13]
[1361] Poirot shook his head energetically. He was now arranging his moustache[1362] with exquisite care.[1363] [13]
[1364] “Not so. _Voyons!_ One fact leads to another—so we continue. Does the[1365] next fit in with that? _A merveille!_ Good! We can proceed. This next[1366] little fact—no! Ah, that is curious! There is something missing—a link[1367] in the chain that is not there. We examine. We search. And that little[1368] curious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally,[1369] we put it here!” He made an extravagant gesture with his hand. “It is[1370] significant! It is tremendous!”[1371] [13]
[1372] “Y—es——”[1373] [13]
[1374] “Ah!” Poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed[1375] before it. “Beware! Peril to the detective who says: ‘It is so small—it[1376] does not matter. It will not agree. I will forget it.’ That way lies[1377] confusion! Everything matters.”[1378] [13]
[1379] “I know. You always told me that. That’s why I have gone into all the[1380] details of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.”[1381] [13]
[1382] “And I am pleased with you. You have a good memory, and you have given[1383] me the facts faithfully. Of the order in which you present them, I say[1384] nothing—truly, it is deplorable! But I make allowances—you are upset.[1385] To that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of[1386] paramount importance.”[1387] [13]
[1388] “What is that?” I asked.[1389] [13]
[1390] “You have not told me if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night.”[1391] [13]
[1392] I stared at him. Surely the war had affected the little man’s brain. He[1393] was carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and[1394] seemed wholly engrossed in the task.[1395] [13]
[1396] “I don’t remember,” I said. “And, anyway, I don’t see——”[1397] [13]
[1398] “You do not see? But it is of the first importance.”[1399] [13]
[1400] “I can’t see why,” I said, rather nettled. “As far as I can remember,[1401] she didn’t eat much. She was obviously upset, and it had taken her[1402] appetite away. That was only natural.”[1403] [13]
[1404] “Yes,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “it was only natural.”[1405] [13]
[1406] He opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to[1407] me.[1408] [13]
[1409] “Now I am ready. We will proceed to the château, and study matters on[1410] the spot. Excuse me, _mon ami_, you dressed in haste, and your tie is[1411] on one side. Permit me.” With a deft gesture, he rearranged it.[1412] [13]
[1413] “_Ça y est!_ Now, shall we start?”[1414] [13]
[1415] We hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates. Poirot[1416] stopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse[1417] of park, still glittering with morning dew.[1418] [13]
[1419] “So beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in[1420] sorrow, prostrated with grief.”[1421] [13]
[1422] He looked at me keenly as he spoke, and I was aware that I reddened[1423] under his prolonged gaze.[1424] [13]
[1425] Was the family prostrated by grief? Was the sorrow at Mrs. Inglethorp’s[1426] death so great? I realized that there was an emotional lack in the[1427] atmosphere. The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. Her[1428] death was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately[1429] regretted.[1430] [13]
[1431] Poirot seemed to follow my thoughts. He nodded his head gravely.[1432] [13]
[1433] “No, you are right,” he said, “it is not as though there was a blood[1434] tie. She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes, but she was[1435] not their own mother. Blood tells—always remember that—blood tells.”[1436] [13]
[1437] “Poirot,” I said, “I wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if[1438] Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night? I have been turning it over in my[1439] mind, but I can’t see how it has anything to do with the matter?”[1440] [13]
[1441] He was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he[1442] said:[1443] [13]
[1444] “I do not mind telling you—though, as you know, it is not my habit to[1445] explain until the end is reached. The present contention is that Mrs.[1446] Inglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her[1447] coffee.”[1448] [13]
[1449] “Yes?”[1450] [13]
[1451] “Well, what time was the coffee served?”[1452] [13]
[1453] “About eight o’clock.”[1454] [13]
[1455] “Therefore she drank it between then and half-past eight—certainly not[1456] much later. Well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison. Its effects[1457] would be felt very soon, probably in about an hour. Yet, in Mrs.[1458] Inglethorp’s case, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five[1459] o’clock the next morning: nine hours! But a heavy meal, taken at about[1460] the same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to[1461] that extent. Still, it is a possibility to be taken into account. But,[1462] according to you, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms[1463] do not develop until early the next morning! Now that is a curious[1464] circumstance, my friend. Something may arise at the autopsy to explain[1465] it. In the meantime, remember it.”[1466] [13]
[1467] As we neared the house, John came out and met us. His face looked weary[1468] and haggard.[1469] [13]
[1470] “This is a very dreadful business, Monsieur Poirot,” he said. “Hastings[1471] has explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity?”[1472] [13]
[1473] “I comprehend perfectly.”[1474] [13]
[1475] “You see, it is only suspicion so far. We have nothing to go upon.”[1476] [13]
[1477] “Precisely. It is a matter of precaution only.”[1478] [13]
[1479] John turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a[1480] cigarette as he did so.[1481] [13]
[1482] “You know that fellow Inglethorp is back?”[1483] [13]
[1484] “Yes. I met him.”[1485] [13]
[1486] John flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which[1487] was too much for Poirot’s feelings. He retrieved it, and buried it[1488] neatly.[1489] [13]
[1490] “It’s jolly difficult to know how to treat him.”[1491] [13]
[1492] “That difficulty will not exist long,” pronounced Poirot quietly.[1493] [13]
[1494] John looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this[1495] cryptic saying. He handed the two keys which Dr. Bauerstein had given[1496] him to me.[1497] [13]
[1498] “Show Monsieur Poirot everything he wants to see.”[1499] [13]
[1500] “The rooms are locked?” asked Poirot.[1501] [13]
[1502] “Dr. Bauerstein considered it advisable.”[1503] [13]
[1504] Poirot nodded thoughtfully.[1505] [13]
[1506] “Then he is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for us.”[1507] [13]
[1508] We went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I[1509] append a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in[1510] it.[1511] [13]
[1512] [Illustration][1513] [13]
[1514] Poirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute[1515] inspection of the room. He darted from one object to the other with the[1516] agility of a grasshopper. I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate[1517] any clues. Poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my[1518] forbearance.[1519] [13]
[1520] “What have you, my friend,” he cried, “that you remain there like—how[1521] do you say it?—ah, yes, the stuck pig?”[1522] [13]
[1523] I explained that I was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks.[1524] [13]
[1525] “Foot-marks? But what an idea! There has already been practically an[1526] army in the room! What foot-marks are we likely to find? No, come here[1527] and aid me in my search. I will put down my little case until I need[1528] it.”[1529] [13]
[1530] He did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised[1531] proceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and[1532] precipitated the despatch-case on the floor.[1533] [13]
[1534] “_Eh voilà une table!_” cried Poirot. “Ah, my friend, one may live in a[1535] big house and yet have no comfort.”[1536] [13]
[1537] After which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search.[1538] [13]
[1539] A small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the[1540] writing-table, engaged his attention for some time. He took out the key[1541] from the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing peculiar,[1542] however. It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a bit of twisted[1543] wire through the handle.[1544] [13]
[1545] Next, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring[1546] himself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went to the door[1547] opposite leading into Cynthia’s room. That door was also bolted, as I[1548] had stated. However, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening[1549] and shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution[1550] against making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed[1551] to rivet his attention. He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly[1552] whipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some[1553] minute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.[1554] [13]
[1555] On the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small[1556] saucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the[1557] saucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood[1558] near it.[1559] [13]
[1560] I wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this.[1561] Here was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his finger into[1562] liquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.[1563] [13]
[1564] “Cocoa—with—I think—rum in it.”[1565] [13]
[1566] He passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had[1567] been overturned. A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys,[1568] and the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about.[1569] [13]
[1570] “Ah, this is curious,” said Poirot.[1571] [13]
[1572] “I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it.”[1573] [13]
[1574] “You do not? Observe the lamp—the chimney is broken in two places; they[1575] lie there as they fell. But see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed[1576] to powder.”[1577] [13]
[1578] “Well,” I said wearily, “I suppose someone must have stepped on it.”[1579] [13]
[1580] “Exactly,” said Poirot, in an odd voice. “Someone stepped on it.”[1581] [13]
[1582] He rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece,[1583] where he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening[1584] them—a trick of his when he was agitated.[1585] [13]
[1586] “_Mon ami_,” he said, turning to me, “somebody stepped on that cup,[1587] grinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it[1588] contained strychnine or—which is far more serious—because it did not[1589] contain strychnine!”[1590] [13]
[1591] I made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no good[1592] asking him to explain. In a moment or two he roused himself, and went[1593] on with his investigations. He picked up the bunch of keys from the[1594] floor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one,[1595] very bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple[1596] despatch-case. It fitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment’s[1597] hesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as[1598] well as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own[1599] pocket.[1600] [13]
[1601] “I have no authority to go through these papers. But it should be[1602] done—at once!”[1603] [13]
[1604] He then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the[1605] wash-stand. Crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain,[1606] hardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him[1607] particularly. He went down on his knees, examining it minutely—even[1608] going so far as to smell it.[1609] [13]
[1610] Finally, he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing[1611] it up carefully. His next proceeding was to take out a little notebook.[1612] [13]
[1613] “We have found in this room,” he said, writing busily, “six points of[1614] interest. Shall I enumerate them, or will you?”[1615] [13]
[1616] “Oh, you,” I replied hastily.[1617] [13]
[1618] “Very well, then. One, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder;[1619] two, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the[1620] floor.”[1621] [13]
[1622] “That may have been done some time ago,” I interrupted.[1623] [13]
[1624] “No, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. Four, a[1625] fragment of some dark green fabric—only a thread or two, but[1626] recognizable.”[1627] [13]
[1628] “Ah!” I cried. “That was what you sealed up in the envelope.”[1629] [13]
[1630] “Yes. It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp’s own[1631] dresses, and quite unimportant. We shall see. Five, _this_!” With a[1632] dramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the[1633] floor by the writing-table. “It must have been done since yesterday,[1634] otherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with[1635] blotting-paper and a hot iron. One of my best hats once—but that is not[1636] to the point.”[1637] [13]
[1638] “It was very likely done last night. We were very agitated. Or perhaps[1639] Mrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her candle.”[1640] [13]
[1641] “You brought only one candle into the room?”[1642] [13]
[1643] “Yes. Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it. But he was very upset. He[1644] seemed to see something over here”—I indicated the mantelpiece—“that[1645] absolutely paralysed him.”[1646] [13]
[1647] “That is interesting,” said Poirot quickly. “Yes, it is suggestive”—his[1648] eye sweeping the whole length of the wall—“but it was not his candle[1649] that made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white grease;[1650] whereas Monsieur Lawrence’s candle, which is still on the[1651] dressing-table, is pink. On the other hand, Mrs. Inglethorp had no[1652] candlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp.”[1653] [13]
[1654] “Then,” I said, “what do you deduce?”[1655] [13]
[1656] To which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to[1657] use my own natural faculties.[1658] [13]
[1659] “And the sixth point?” I asked. “I suppose it is the sample of cocoa.”[1660] [13]
[1661] “No,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “I might have included that in the six,[1662] but I did not. No, the sixth point I will keep to myself for the[1663] present.”[1664] [13]
[1665] He looked quickly round the room. “There is nothing more to be done[1666] here, I think, unless”—he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes[1667] in the grate. “The fire burns—and it destroys. But by chance—there[1668] might be—let us see!”[1669] [13]
[1670] Deftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate[1671] into the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. Suddenly, he[1672] gave a faint exclamation.[1673] [13]
[1674] “The forceps, Hastings!”[1675] [13]
[1676] I quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece[1677] of half charred paper.[1678] [13]
[1679] “There, _mon ami!_” he cried. “What do you think of that?”[1680] [13]
[1681] I scrutinized the fragment. This is an exact reproduction of it:—[1682] [13]
[1683] [Illustration][1684] [13]
[1685] I was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper.[1686] Suddenly an idea struck me.[1687] [13]
[1688] “Poirot!” I cried. “This is a fragment of a will!”[1689] [13]
[1690] “Exactly.”[1691] [13]
[1692] I looked up at him sharply.[1693] [13]
[1694] “You are not surprised?”[1695] [13]
[1696] “No,” he said gravely, “I expected it.”[1697] [13]
[1698] I relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his[1699] case, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything. My[1700] brain was in a whirl. What was this complication of a will? Who had[1701] destroyed it? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor?[1702] Obviously. But how had anyone gained admission? All the doors had been[1703] bolted on the inside.[1704] [13]
[1705] “Now, my friend,” said Poirot briskly, “we will go. I should like to[1706] ask a few questions of the parlourmaid—Dorcas, her name is, is it not?”[1707] [13]
[1708] We passed through Alfred Inglethorp’s room, and Poirot delayed long[1709] enough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it. We[1710] went out through that door, locking both it and that of Mrs.[1711] Inglethorp’s room as before.[1712] [13]
[1713] I took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see,[1714] and went myself in search of Dorcas.[1715] [13]
[1716] When I returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty.[1717] [13]
[1718] “Poirot,” I cried, “where are you?”[1719] [13]
[1720] “I am here, my friend.”[1721] [13]
[1722] He had stepped outside the French window, and was standing, apparently[1723] lost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds.[1724] [13]
[1725] “Admirable!” he murmured. “Admirable! What symmetry! Observe that[1726] crescent; and those diamonds—their neatness rejoices the eye. The[1727] spacing of the plants, also, is perfect. It has been recently done; is[1728] it not so?”[1729] [13]
[1730] “Yes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come in—Dorcas[1731] is here.”[1732] [13]
[1733] “_Eh bien, eh bien!_ Do not grudge me a moment’s satisfaction of the[1734] eye.”[1735] [13]
[1736] “Yes, but this affair is more important.”[1737] [13]
[1738] “And how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal[1739] importance?”[1740] [13]
[1741] I shrugged my shoulders. There was really no arguing with him if he[1742] chose to take that line.[1743] [13]
[1744] “You do not agree? But such things have been. Well, we will come in and[1745] interview the brave Dorcas.”[1746] [13]
[1747] Dorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her,[1748] and her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. She was the[1749] very model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.[1750] [13]
[1751] In her attitude towards Poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but[1752] he soon broke down her defences. He drew forward a chair.[1753] [13]
[1754] “Pray be seated, mademoiselle.”[1755] [13]
[1756] “Thank you, sir.”[1757] [13]
[1758] “You have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?”[1759] [13]
[1760] “Ten years, sir.”[1761] [13]
[1762] “That is a long time, and very faithful service. You were much attached[1763] to her, were you not?”[1764] [13]
[1765] “She was a very good mistress to me, sir.”[1766] [13]
[1767] “Then you will not object to answering a few questions. I put them to[1768] you with Mr. Cavendish’s full approval.”[1769] [13]
[1770] “Oh, certainly, sir.”[1771] [13]
[1772] “Then I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday[1773] afternoon. Your mistress had a quarrel?”[1774] [13]
[1775] “Yes, sir. But I don’t know that I ought——” Dorcas hesitated.[1776] [13]
[1777] Poirot looked at her keenly.[1778] [13]
[1779] “My good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of[1780] that quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying[1781] your mistress’s secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary[1782] that we should know all—if we are to avenge her. Nothing can bring her[1783] back to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the[1784] murderer to justice.”[1785] [13]
[1786] “Amen to that,” said Dorcas fiercely. “And, naming no names, there’s[1787] _one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it[1788] was when first _he_ darkened the threshold.”[1789] [13]
[1790] Poirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his[1791] business-like tone, he asked:[1792] [13]
[1793] “Now, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of it?”[1794] [13]
[1795] “Well, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday——”[1796] [13]
[1797] “What time was that?”[1798] [13]
[1799] “I couldn’t say exactly, sir, but it wasn’t tea-time by a long way.[1800] Perhaps four o’clock—or it may have been a bit later. Well, sir, as I[1801] said, I happened to be passing along, when I heard voices very loud and[1802] angry in here. I didn’t exactly mean to listen, but—well, there it is.[1803] I stopped. The door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp[1804] and clear, and I heard what she said quite plainly. ‘You have lied to[1805] me, and deceived me,’ she said. I didn’t hear what Mr. Inglethorp[1806] replied. He spoke a good bit lower than she did—but she answered: ‘How[1807] dare you? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you! You owe[1808] everything to me! And this is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace[1809] upon our name!’ Again I didn’t hear what he said, but she went on:[1810] ‘Nothing that you can say will make any difference. I see my duty[1811] clearly. My mind is made up. You need not think that any fear of[1812] publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.’ Then I[1813] thought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly.”[1814] [13]
[1815] “You are sure it was Mr. Inglethorp’s voice you heard?”[1816] [13]
[1817] “Oh, yes, sir, whose else’s could it be?”[1818] [13]
[1819] “Well, what happened next?”[1820] [13]
[1821] “Later, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five o’clock,[1822] Mrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of[1823] tea—nothing to eat—to the boudoir. She was looking dreadful—so white[1824] and upset. ‘Dorcas,’ she says, ‘I’ve had a great shock.’ ‘I’m sorry for[1825] that, m’m,’ I says. ‘You’ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea,[1826] m’m.’ She had something in her hand. I don’t know if it was a letter,[1827] or just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept[1828] staring at it, almost as if she couldn’t believe what was written[1829] there. She whispered to herself, as though she had forgotten I was[1830] there: ‘These few words—and everything’s changed.’ And then she says to[1831] me: ‘Never trust a man, Dorcas, they’re not worth it!’ I hurried off,[1832] and got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said[1833] she’d feel better when she’d drunk it. ‘I don’t know what to do,’ she[1834] says. ‘Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas.[1835] I’d rather hush it up if I could.’ Mrs. Cavendish came in just then, so[1836] she didn’t say any more.”[1837] [13]
[1838] “She still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand?”[1839] [13]
[1840] [13]
[1841] [13]
[1842] “Yes, sir.”[1843] [13]
[1844] “What would she be likely to do with it afterwards?”[1845] [13]
[1846] “Well, I don’t know, sir, I expect she would lock it up in that purple[1847] case of hers.”[1848] [13]
[1849] “Is that where she usually kept important papers?”[1850] [13]
[1851] “Yes, sir. She brought it down with her every morning, and took it up[1852] every night.”[1853] [13]
[1854] “When did she lose the key of it?”[1855] [13]
[1856] “She missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look[1857] carefully for it. She was very much put out about it.”[1858] [13]
[1859] “But she had a duplicate key?”[1860] [13]
[1861] “Oh, yes, sir.”[1862] [13]
[1863] Dorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was[1864] I. What was all this about a lost key? Poirot smiled.[1865] [13]
[1866] “Never mind, Dorcas, it is my business to know things. Is this the key[1867] that was lost?” He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in[1868] the lock of the despatch-case upstairs.[1869] [13]
[1870] Dorcas’s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head.[1871] [13]
[1872] “That’s it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I looked[1873] everywhere for it.”[1874] [13]
[1875] “Ah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was[1876] to-day. Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green[1877] dress in her wardrobe?”[1878] [13]
[1879] Dorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question.[1880] [13]
[1881] “No, sir.”[1882] [13]
[1883] “Are you quite sure?”[1884] [13]
[1885] “Oh, yes, sir.”[1886] [13]
[1887] “Has anyone else in the house got a green dress?”[1888] [13]
[1889] Dorcas reflected.[1890] [13]
[1891] “Miss Cynthia has a green evening dress.”[1892] [13]
[1893] “Light or dark green?”[1894] [13]
[1895] “A light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.”[1896] [13]
[1897] “Ah, that is not what I want. And nobody else has anything green?”[1898] [13]
[1899] “No, sir—not that I know of.”[1900] [13]
[1901] Poirot’s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or[1902] otherwise. He merely remarked:[1903] [13]
[1904] “Good, we will leave that and pass on. Have you any reason to believe[1905] that your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?”[1906] [13]
[1907] “Not _last_ night, sir, I know she didn’t.”[1908] [13]
[1909] “Why do you know so positively?”[1910] [13]
[1911] “Because the box was empty. She took the last one two days ago, and she[1912] didn’t have any more made up.”[1913] [13]
[1914] “You are quite sure of that?”[1915] [13]
[1916] “Positive, sir.”[1917] [13]
[1918] “Then that is cleared up! By the way, your mistress didn’t ask you to[1919] sign any paper yesterday?”[1920] [13]
[1921] “To sign a paper? No, sir.”[1922] [13]
[1923] “When Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening, they[1924] found your mistress busy writing letters. I suppose you can give me no[1925] idea to whom these letters were addressed?”[1926] [13]
[1927] “I’m afraid I couldn’t, sir. I was out in the evening. Perhaps Annie[1928] could tell you, though she’s a careless girl. Never cleared the[1929] coffee-cups away last night. That’s what happens when I’m not here to[1930] look after things.”[1931] [13]
[1932] Poirot lifted his hand.[1933] [13]
[1934] “Since they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer, I pray[1935] you. I should like to examine them.”[1936] [13]
[1937] “Very well, sir.”[1938] [13]
[1939] “What time did you go out last evening?”[1940] [13]
[1941] “About six o’clock, sir.”[1942] [13]
[1943] “Thank you, Dorcas, that is all I have to ask you.” He rose and[1944] strolled to the window. “I have been admiring these flower beds. How[1945] many gardeners are employed here, by the way?”[1946] [13]
[1947] “Only three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as[1948] a gentleman’s place should be. I wish you could have seen it then, sir.[1949] A fair sight it was. But now there’s only old Manning, and young[1950] William, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like.[1951] Ah, these are dreadful times!”[1952] [13]
[1953] “The good times will come again, Dorcas. At least, we hope so. Now,[1954] will you send Annie to me here?”[1955] [13]
[1956] “Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.”[1957] [13]
[1958] “How did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders?” I asked,[1959] in lively curiosity, as Dorcas left the room. “And about the lost key[1960] and the duplicate?”[1961] [13]
[1962] “One thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by this.” He[1963] suddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for[1964] powders.[1965] [13]
[1966] “Where did you find it?”[1967] [13]
[1968] “In the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp’s bedroom. It was Number[1969] Six of my catalogue.”[1970] [13]
[1971] “But I suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of[1972] much importance?”[1973] [13]
[1974] “Probably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar[1975] about this box?”[1976] [13]
[1977] I examined it closely.[1978] [13]
[1979] “No, I can’t say that I do.”[1980] [13]
[1981] “Look at the label.”[1982] [13]
[1983] I read the label carefully: “‘One powder to be taken at bedtime, if[1984] required. Mrs. Inglethorp.’ No, I see nothing unusual.”[1985] [13]
[1986] “Not the fact that there is no chemist’s name?”[1987] [13]
[1988] “Ah!” I exclaimed. “To be sure, that is odd!”[1989] [13]
[1990] “Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his[1991] printed name?”[1992] [13]
[1993] “No, I can’t say that I have.”[1994] [13]
[1995] I was becoming quite excited, but Poirot damped my ardour by remarking:[1996] [13]
[1997] “Yet the explanation is quite simple. So do not intrigue yourself, my[1998] friend.”[1999] [13]
[2000] An audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie, so I had no time[2001] to reply.[2002] [13]
[2003] Annie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under[2004] intense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the[2005] tragedy.[2006] [13]
[2007] Poirot came to the point at once, with a business-like briskness.[2008] [13]
[2009] “I sent for you, Annie, because I thought you might be able to tell me[2010] something about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night. How many[2011] were there? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses?”[2012] [13]
[2013] Annie considered.[2014] [13]
[2015] “There were four letters, sir. One was to Miss Howard, and one was to[2016] Mr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I don’t think I remember,[2017] sir—oh, yes, one was to Ross’s, the caterers in Tadminster. The other[2018] one, I don’t remember.”[2019] [13]
[2020] “Think,” urged Poirot.[2021] [13]
[2022] Annie racked her brains in vain.[2023] [13]
[2024] “I’m sorry, sir, but it’s clean gone. I don’t think I can have noticed[2025] it.”[2026] [13]
[2027] “It does not matter,” said Poirot, not betraying any sign of[2028] disappointment. “Now I want to ask you about something else. There is a[2029] saucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room with some cocoa in it. Did she have[2030] that every night?”[2031] [13]
[2032] “Yes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up[2033] in the night—whenever she fancied it.”[2034] [13]
[2035] “What was it? Plain cocoa?”[2036] [13]
[2037] “Yes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two[2038] teaspoonfuls of rum in it.”[2039] [13]
[2040] “Who took it to her room?”[2041] [13]
[2042] “I did, sir.”[2043] [13]
[2044] “Always?”[2045] [13]
[2046] “Yes, sir.”[2047] [13]
[2048] “At what time?”[2049] [13]
[2050] “When I went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir.”[2051] [13]
[2052] “Did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?”[2053] [13]
[2054] “No, sir, you see there’s not much room on the gas stove, so cook used[2055] to make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper. Then I[2056] used to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and[2057] take it into her room later.”[2058] [13]
[2059] “The swing door is in the left wing, is it not?”[2060] [13]
[2061] “Yes, sir.”[2062] [13]
[2063] “And the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the[2064] farther—servants’ side?”[2065] [13]
[2066] “It’s this side, sir.”[2067] [13]
[2068] “What time did you bring it up last night?”[2069] [13]
[2070] “About quarter-past seven, I should say, sir.”[2071] [13]
[2072] “And when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp’s room?”[2073] [13]
[2074] “When I went to shut up, sir. About eight o’clock. Mrs. Inglethorp came[2075] up to bed before I’d finished.”[2076] [13]
[2077] “Then, between seven-fifteen and eight o’clock, the cocoa was standing[2078] on the table in the left wing?”[2079] [13]
[2080] “Yes, sir.” Annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and[2081] now she blurted out unexpectedly:[2082] [13]
[2083] “And if there _was_ salt in it, sir, it wasn’t me. I never took the[2084] salt near it.”[2085] [13]
[2086] “What makes you think there was salt in it?” asked Poirot.[2087] [13]
[2088] “Seeing it on the tray, sir.”[2089] [13]
[2090] “You saw some salt on the tray?”[2091] [13]
[2092] “Yes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked. I never noticed it when I took[2093] the tray up, but when I came to take it into the mistress’s room I saw[2094] it at once, and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again, and[2095] asked cook to make some fresh. But I was in a hurry, because Dorcas was[2096] out, and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt[2097] had only gone on the tray. So I dusted it off with my apron, and took[2098] it in.”[2099] [13]
[2100] I had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement. Unknown to[2101] herself, Annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence. How[2102] she would have gaped if she had realized that her “coarse kitchen salt”[2103] was strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. I[2104] marvelled at Poirot’s calm. His self-control was astonishing. I awaited[2105] his next question with impatience, but it disappointed me.[2106] [13]
[2107] “When you went into Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, was the door leading into[2108] Miss Cynthia’s room bolted?”[2109] [13]
[2110] “Oh! Yes, sir; it always was. It had never been opened.”[2111] [13]
[2112] “And the door into Mr. Inglethorp’s room? Did you notice if that was[2113] bolted too?”[2114] [13]
[2115] Annie hesitated.[2116] [13]
[2117] “I couldn’t rightly say, sir; it was shut but I couldn’t say whether it[2118] was bolted or not.”[2119] [13]
[2120] “When you finally left the room, did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door[2121] after you?”[2122] [13]
[2123] “No, sir, not then, but I expect she did later. She usually did lock it[2124] at night. The door into the passage, that is.”[2125] [13]
[2126] “Did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room[2127] yesterday?”[2128] [13]
[2129] “Candle grease? Oh, no, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp didn’t have a candle, only[2130] a reading-lamp.”[2131] [13]
[2132] “Then, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor,[2133] you think you would have been sure to have seen it?”[2134] [13]
[2135] “Yes, sir, and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper[2136] and a hot iron.”[2137] [13]
[2138] Then Poirot repeated the question he had put to Dorcas:[2139] [13]
[2140] “Did your mistress ever have a green dress?”[2141] [13]
[2142] “No, sir.”[2143] [13]
[2144] “Nor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a—how do you call it?—a sports coat?”[2145] [13]
[2146] “Not green, sir.”[2147] [13]
[2148] “Nor anyone else in the house?”[2149] [13]
[2150] Annie reflected.[2151] [13]
[2152] “No, sir.”[2153] [13]
[2154] “You are sure of that?”[2155] [13]
[2156] “Quite sure.”[2157] [13]
[2158] “_Bien!_ That is all I want to know. Thank you very much.”[2159] [13]
[2160] With a nervous giggle, Annie took herself creakingly out of the room.[2161] My pent-up excitement burst forth.[2162] [13]
[2163] “Poirot,” I cried, “I congratulate you! This is a great discovery.”[2164] [13]
[2165] “What is a great discovery?”[2166] [13]
[2167] “Why, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned. That[2168] explains everything! Of course it did not take effect until the early[2169] morning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.”[2170] [13]
[2171] “So you think that the cocoa—mark well what I say, Hastings, the[2172] _cocoa_—contained strychnine?”[2173] [13]
[2174] “Of course! That salt on the tray, what else could it have been?”[2175] [13]
[2176] “It might have been salt,” replied Poirot placidly.[2177] [13]
[2178] I shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way,[2179] it was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the[2180] first time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately I thought[2181] it lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive[2182] type of mind.[2183] [13]
[2184] Poirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.[2185] [13]
[2186] “You are not pleased with me, _mon ami?_”[2187] [13]
[2188] “My dear Poirot,” I said coldly, “it is not for me to dictate to you.[2189] You have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.”[2190] [13]
[2191] “A most admirable sentiment,” remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his[2192] feet. “Now I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the[2193] smaller desk in the corner?”[2194] [13]
[2195] “Mr. Inglethorp’s.”[2196] [13]
[2197] “Ah!” He tried the roll top tentatively. “Locked. But perhaps one of[2198] Mrs. Inglethorp’s keys would open it.” He tried several, twisting and[2199] turning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation[2200] of satisfaction. “_Voilà!_ It is not the key, but it will open it at a[2201] pinch.” He slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly[2202] filed papers. To my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking[2203] approvingly as he relocked the desk: “Decidedly, he is a man of method,[2204] this Mr. Inglethorp!”[2205] [13]
[2206] A “man of method” was, in Poirot’s estimation, the highest praise that[2207] could be bestowed on any individual.[2208] [13]
[2209] I felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on[2210] disconnectedly:[2211] [13]
[2212] “There were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh, _mon[2213] ami?_ There might have been? Yes”—his eyes wandered round the[2214] room—“this boudoir has nothing more to tell us. It did not yield much.[2215] Only this.”[2216] [13]
[2217] He pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket, and tossed it over to[2218] me. It was rather a curious document. A plain, dirty looking old[2219] envelope with a few words scrawled across it, apparently at random. The[2220] following is a facsimile of it.[2221] [13]
[2222] [Illustration][2223] [13]
[2224] [13]
[2225] [13]
[2226] [13]
[2227] CHAPTER V.[2228] “IT ISN’T STRYCHNINE, IS IT?”[2229] [13]
[2230] [13]
[2231] “Where did you find this?” I asked Poirot, in lively curiosity.[2232] [13]
[2233] “In the waste-paper basket. You recognise the handwriting?”[2234] [13]
[2235] “Yes, it is Mrs. Inglethorp’s. But what does it mean?”[2236] [13]
[2237] Poirot shrugged his shoulders.[2238] [13]
[2239] “I cannot say—but it is suggestive.”[2240] [13]
[2241] A wild idea flashed across me. Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorp’s[2242] mind was deranged? Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal[2243] possession? And, if that were so, was it not also possible that she[2244] might have taken her own life?[2245] [13]
[2246] I was about to expound these theories to Poirot, when his own words[2247] distracted me.[2248] [13]
[2249] “Come,” he said, “now to examine the coffee-cups!”[2250] [13]
[2251] “My dear Poirot! What on earth is the good of that, now that we know[2252] about the cocoa?”[2253] [13]
[2254] “Oh, _là là!_ That miserable cocoa!” cried Poirot flippantly.[2255] [13]
[2256] He laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock[2257] despair, in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste.[2258] [13]
[2259] “And, anyway,” I said, with increasing coldness, “as Mrs. Inglethorp[2260] took her coffee upstairs with her, I do not see what you expect to[2261] find, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of[2262] strychnine on the coffee tray!”[2263] [13]
[2264] Poirot was sobered at once.[2265] [13]
[2266] “Come, come, my friend,” he said, slipping his arms through mine. “_Ne[2267] vous fâchez pas!_ Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and I[2268] will respect your cocoa. There! Is it a bargain?”[2269] [13]
[2270] He was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh; and we went[2271] together to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained[2272] undisturbed as we had left them.[2273] [13]
[2274] Poirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening[2275] very carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups.[2276] [13]
[2277] “So Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray—and poured out. Yes. Then she came[2278] across to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia. Yes. Here[2279] are the three cups. And the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that[2280] would be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish’s. And the one on the tray?”[2281] [13]
[2282] “John Cavendish’s. I saw him put it down there.”[2283] [13]
[2284] “Good. One, two, three, four, five—but where, then, is the cup of Mr.[2285] Inglethorp?”[2286] [13]
[2287] “He does not take coffee.”[2288] [13]
[2289] “Then all are accounted for. One moment, my friend.”[2290] [13]
[2291] With infinite care, he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup,[2292] sealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he did[2293] so. His physiognomy underwent a curious change. An expression gathered[2294] there that I can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved.[2295] [13]
[2296] “_Bien!_” he said at last. “It is evident! I had an idea—but clearly I[2297] was mistaken. Yes, altogether I was mistaken. Yet it is strange. But no[2298] matter!”[2299] [13]
[2300] And, with a characteristic shrug, he dismissed whatever it was that was[2301] worrying him from his mind. I could have told him from the beginning[2302] that this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind[2303] alley, but I restrained my tongue. After all, though he was old, Poirot[2304] had been a great man in his day.[2305] [13]
[2306] “Breakfast is ready,” said John Cavendish, coming in from the hall.[2307] “You will breakfast with us, Monsieur Poirot?”[2308] [13]
[2309] Poirot acquiesced. I observed John. Already he was almost restored to[2310] his normal self. The shock of the events of the last night had upset[2311] him temporarily, but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal.[2312] He was a man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his[2313] brother, who had, perhaps, too much.[2314] [13]
[2315] Ever since the early hours of the morning, John had been hard at work,[2316] sending telegrams—one of the first had gone to Evelyn Howard—writing[2317] notices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the[2318] melancholy duties that a death entails.[2319] [13]
[2320] “May I ask how things are proceeding?” he said. “Do your investigations[2321] point to my mother having died a natural death—or—or must we prepare[2322] ourselves for the worst?”[2323] [13]
[2324] “I think, Mr. Cavendish,” said Poirot gravely, “that you would do well[2325] not to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. Can you tell me the views[2326] of the other members of the family?”[2327] [13]
[2328] “My brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over[2329] nothing. He says that everything points to its being a simple case of[2330] heart failure.”[2331] [13]
[2332] “He does, does he? That is very interesting—very interesting,” murmured[2333] Poirot softly. “And Mrs. Cavendish?”[2334] [13]
[2335] A faint cloud passed over John’s face.[2336] [13]
[2337] “I have not the least idea what my wife’s views on the subject are.”[2338] [13]
[2339] The answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train. John broke the[2340] rather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort:[2341] [13]
[2342] “I told you, didn’t I, that Mr. Inglethorp has returned?”[2343] [13]
[2344] Poirot bent his head.[2345] [13]
[2346] “It’s an awkward position for all of us. Of course one has to treat him[2347] as usual—but, hang it all, one’s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat[2348] with a possible murderer!”[2349] [13]
[2350] Poirot nodded sympathetically.[2351] [13]
[2352] “I quite understand. It is a very difficult situation for you, Mr.[2353] Cavendish. I would like to ask you one question. Mr. Inglethorp’s[2354] reason for not returning last night was, I believe, that he had[2355] forgotten the latch-key. Is not that so?”[2356] [13]
[2357] “Yes.”[2358] [13]
[2359] “I suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key _was_ forgotten—that[2360] he did not take it after all?”[2361] [13]
[2362] “I have no idea. I never thought of looking. We always keep it in the[2363] hall drawer. I’ll go and see if it’s there now.”[2364] [13]
[2365] Poirot held up his hand with a faint smile.[2366] [13]
[2367] “No, no, Mr. Cavendish, it is too late now. I am certain that you would[2368] find it. If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to[2369] replace it by now.”[2370] [13]
[2371] “But do you think——”[2372] [13]
[2373] “I think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his[2374] return, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his[2375] favour. That is all.”[2376] [13]
[2377] John looked perplexed.[2378] [13]
[2379] “Do not worry,” said Poirot smoothly. “I assure you that you need not[2380] let it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some[2381] breakfast.”[2382] [13]
[2383] Everyone was assembled in the dining-room. Under the circumstances, we[2384] were naturally not a cheerful party. The reaction after a shock is[2385] always trying, and I think we were all suffering from it. Decorum and[2386] good breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as[2387] usual, yet I could not help wondering if this self-control were really[2388] a matter of great difficulty. There were no red eyes, no signs of[2389] secretly indulged grief. I felt that I was right in my opinion that[2390] Dorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the[2391] tragedy.[2392] [13]
[2393] I pass over Alfred Inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a[2394] manner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy. Did he know that[2395] we suspected him, I wondered. Surely he could not be unaware of the[2396] fact, conceal it as we would. Did he feel some secret stirring of fear,[2397] or was he confident that his crime would go unpunished? Surely the[2398] suspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked[2399] man.[2400] [13]
[2401] But did everyone suspect him? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched her[2402] as she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. In[2403] her soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her[2404] slender hands, she looked very beautiful. When she chose, however, her[2405] face could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability. She was very silent,[2406] hardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way I felt that the[2407] great strength of her personality was dominating us all.[2408] [13]
[2409] And little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She looked very tired and ill, I[2410] thought. The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. I[2411] asked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly:[2412] [13]
[2413] “Yes, I’ve got the most beastly headache.”[2414] [13]
[2415] “Have another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?” said Poirot solicitously.[2416] “It will revive you. It is unparalleled for the _mal de tête_.” He[2417] jumped up and took her cup.[2418] [13]
[2419] “No sugar,” said Cynthia, watching him, as he picked up the[2420] sugar-tongs.[2421] [13]
[2422] “No sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?”[2423] [13]
[2424] “No, I never take it in coffee.”[2425] [13]
[2426] “_Sacré!_” murmured Poirot to himself, as he brought back the[2427] replenished cup.[2428] [13]
[2429] Only I heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw[2430] that his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were[2431] as green as a cat’s. He had heard or seen something that had affected[2432] him strongly—but what was it? I do not usually label myself as dense,[2433] but I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_[2434] attention.[2435] [13]
[2436] In another moment, the door opened and Dorcas appeared.[2437] [13]
[2438] “Mr. Wells to see you, sir,” she said to John.[2439] [13]
[2440] I remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs.[2441] Inglethorp had written the night before.[2442] [13]
[2443] John rose immediately.[2444] [13]
[2445] “Show him into my study.” Then he turned to us. “My mother’s lawyer,”[2446] he explained. And in a lower voice: “He is also Coroner—you understand.[2447] Perhaps you would like to come with me?”[2448] [13]
[2449] We acquiesced and followed him out of the room. John strode on ahead[2450] and I took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot:[2451] [13]
[2452] “There will be an inquest then?”[2453] [13]
[2454] Poirot nodded absently. He seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that[2455] my curiosity was aroused.[2456] [13]
[2457] “What is it? You are not attending to what I say.”[2458] [13]
[2459] “It is true, my friend. I am much worried.”[2460] [13]
[2461] “Why?”[2462] [13]
[2463] “Because Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.”[2464] [13]
[2465] “What? You cannot be serious?”[2466] [13]
[2467] “But I am most serious. Ah, there is something there that I do not[2468] understand. My instinct was right.”[2469] [13]
[2470] “What instinct?”[2471] [13]
[2472] “The instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups.[2473] _Chut!_ no more now!”[2474] [13]
[2475] We followed John into his study, and he closed the door behind us.[2476] [13]
[2477] Mr. Wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the[2478] typical lawyer’s mouth. John introduced us both, and explained the[2479] reason of our presence.[2480] [13]
[2481] “You will understand, Wells,” he added, “that this is all strictly[2482] private. We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for[2483] investigation of any kind.”[2484] [13]
[2485] “Quite so, quite so,” said Mr. Wells soothingly. “I wish we could have[2486] spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it’s[2487] quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor’s certificate.”[2488] [13]
[2489] “Yes, I suppose so.”[2490] [13]
[2491] “Clever man, Bauerstein. Great authority on toxicology, I believe.”[2492] [13]
[2493] “Indeed,” said John with a certain stiffness in his manner. Then he[2494] added rather hesitatingly: “Shall we have to appear as witnesses—all of[2495] us, I mean?”[2496] [13]
[2497] “You, of course—and ah—er—Mr.—er—Inglethorp.”[2498] [13]
[2499] A slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner:[2500] [13]
[2501] “Any other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of[2502] form.”[2503] [13]
[2504] “I see.”[2505] [13]
[2506] A faint expression of relief swept over John’s face. It puzzled me, for[2507] I saw no occasion for it.[2508] [13]
[2509] “If you know of nothing to the contrary,” pursued Mr. Wells, “I had[2510] thought of Friday. That will give us plenty of time for the doctor’s[2511] report. The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?”[2512] [13]
[2513] “Yes.”[2514] [13]
[2515] “Then that arrangement will suit you?”[2516] [13]
[2517] “Perfectly.”[2518] [13]
[2519] “I need not tell you, my dear Cavendish, how distressed I am at this[2520] most tragic affair.”[2521] [13]
[2522] “Can you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?” interposed Poirot,[2523] speaking for the first time since we had entered the room.[2524] [13]
[2525] “I?”[2526] [13]
[2527] “Yes, we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night. You should[2528] have received the letter this morning.”[2529] [13]
[2530] “I did, but it contains no information. It is merely a note asking me[2531] to call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of[2532] great importance.”[2533] [13]
[2534] “She gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?”[2535] [13]
[2536] “Unfortunately, no.”[2537] [13]
[2538] “That is a pity,” said John.[2539] [13]
[2540] “A great pity,” agreed Poirot gravely.[2541] [13]
[2542] There was silence. Poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes.[2543] Finally he turned to the lawyer again.[2544] [13]
[2545] “Mr. Wells, there is one thing I should like to ask you—that is, if it[2546] is not against professional etiquette. In the event of Mrs.[2547] Inglethorp’s death, who would inherit her money?”[2548] [13]
[2549] The lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied:[2550] [13]
[2551] “The knowledge will be public property very soon, so if Mr. Cavendish[2552] does not object——”[2553] [13]
[2554] “Not at all,” interpolated John.[2555] [13]
[2556] “I do not see any reason why I should not answer your question. By her[2557] last will, dated August of last year, after various unimportant[2558] legacies to servants, etc., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson,[2559] Mr. John Cavendish.”[2560] [13]
[2561] “Was not that—pardon the question, Mr. Cavendish—rather unfair to her[2562] other stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?”[2563] [13]
[2564] “No, I do not think so. You see, under the terms of their father’s[2565] will, while John inherited the property, Lawrence, at his stepmother’s[2566] death, would come into a considerable sum of money. Mrs. Inglethorp[2567] left her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep[2568] up Styles. It was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.”[2569] [13]
[2570] Poirot nodded thoughtfully.[2571] [13]
[2572] “I see. But I am right in saying, am I not, that by your English law[2573] that will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried?”[2574] [13]
[2575] Mr. Wells bowed his head.[2576] [13]
[2577] “As I was about to proceed, Monsieur Poirot, that document is now null[2578] and void.”[2579] [13]
[2580] “_Hein!_” said Poirot. He reflected for a moment, and then asked: “Was[2581] Mrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact?”[2582] [13]
[2583] “I do not know. She may have been.”[2584] [13]
[2585] “She was,” said John unexpectedly. “We were discussing the matter of[2586] wills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.”[2587] [13]
[2588] “Ah! One more question, Mr. Wells. You say ‘her last will.’ Had Mrs.[2589] Inglethorp, then, made several former wills?”[2590] [13]
[2591] “On an average, she made a new will at least once a year,” said Mr.[2592] Wells imperturbably. “She was given to changing her mind as to her[2593] testamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of[2594] her family.”[2595] [13]
[2596] “Suppose,” suggested Poirot, “that, unknown to you, she had made a new[2597] will in favour of someone who was not, in any sense of the word, a[2598] member of the family—we will say Miss Howard, for instance—would you be[2599] surprised?”[2600] [13]
[2601] “Not in the least.”[2602] [13]
[2603] “Ah!” Poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions.[2604] [13]
[2605] I drew close to him, while John and the lawyer were debating the[2606] question of going through Mrs. Inglethorp’s papers.[2607] [13]
[2608] “Do you think Mrs. Inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to Miss[2609] Howard?” I asked in a low voice, with some curiosity.[2610] [13]
[2611] Poirot smiled.[2612] [13]
[2613] “No.”[2614] [13]
[2615] “Then why did you ask?”[2616] [13]
[2617] “Hush!”[2618] [13]
[2619] John Cavendish had turned to Poirot.[2620] [13]
[2621] “Will you come with us, Monsieur Poirot? We are going through my[2622] mother’s papers. Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely[2623] to Mr. Wells and myself.”[2624] [13]
[2625] “Which simplifies matters very much,” murmured the lawyer. “As[2626] technically, of course, he was entitled——” He did not finish the[2627] sentence.[2628] [13]
[2629] “We will look through the desk in the boudoir first,” explained John,[2630] “and go up to her bedroom afterwards. She kept her most important[2631] papers in a purple despatch-case, which we must look through[2632] carefully.”[2633] [13]
[2634] “Yes,” said the lawyer, “it is quite possible that there may be a later[2635] will than the one in my possession.”[2636] [13]
[2637] “There _is_ a later will.” It was Poirot who spoke.[2638] [13]
[2639] “What?” John and the lawyer looked at him startled.[2640] [13]
[2641] “Or, rather,” pursued my friend imperturbably, “there _was_ one.”[2642] [13]
[2643] “What do you mean—there was one? Where is it now?”[2644] [13]
[2645] “Burnt!”[2646] [13]
[2647] “Burnt?”[2648] [13]
[2649] “Yes. See here.” He took out the charred fragment we had found in the[2650] grate in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, and handed it to the lawyer with a[2651] brief explanation of when and where he had found it.[2652] [13]
[2653] “But possibly this is an old will?”[2654] [13]
[2655] “I do not think so. In fact I am almost certain that it was made no[2656] earlier than yesterday afternoon.”[2657] [13]
[2658] “What?” “Impossible!” broke simultaneously from both men.[2659] [13]
[2660] Poirot turned to John.[2661] [13]
[2662] “If you will allow me to send for your gardener, I will prove it to[2663] you.”[2664] [13]
[2665] “Oh, of course—but I don’t see——”[2666] [13]
[2667] Poirot raised his hand.[2668] [13]
[2669] “Do as I ask you. Afterwards you shall question as much as you please.”[2670] [13]
[2671] “Very well.” He rang the bell.[2672] [13]
[2673] Dorcas answered it in due course.[2674] [13]
[2675] “Dorcas, will you tell Manning to come round and speak to me here.”[2676] [13]
[2677] “Yes, sir.”[2678] [13]
[2679] Dorcas withdrew.[2680] [13]
[2681] We waited in a tense silence. Poirot alone seemed perfectly at his[2682] ease, and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase.[2683] [13]
[2684] The clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the[2685] approach of Manning. John looked questioningly at Poirot. The latter[2686] nodded.[2687] [13]
[2688] “Come inside, Manning,” said John, “I want to speak to you.”[2689] [13]
[2690] Manning came slowly and hesitatingly through the French window, and[2691] stood as near it as he could. He held his cap in his hands, twisting it[2692] very carefully round and round. His back was much bent, though he was[2693] probably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and[2694] intelligent, and belied his slow and rather cautious speech.[2695] [13]
[2696] “Manning,” said John, “this gentleman will put some questions to you[2697] which I want you to answer.”[2698] [13]
[2699] “Yessir,” mumbled Manning.[2700] [13]
[2701] Poirot stepped forward briskly. Manning’s eye swept over him with a[2702] faint contempt.[2703] [13]
[2704] “You were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the[2705] house yesterday afternoon, were you not, Manning?”[2706] [13]
[2707] “Yes, sir, me and Willum.”[2708] [13]
[2709] “And Mrs. Inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not?”[2710] [13]
[2711] “Yes, sir, she did.”[2712] [13]
[2713] “Tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.”[2714] [13]
[2715] “Well, sir, nothing much. She just told Willum to go on his bicycle[2716] down to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like—I[2717] don’t know what exactly—she wrote it down for him.”[2718] [13]
[2719] “Well?”[2720] [13]
[2721] “Well, he did, sir.”[2722] [13]
[2723] “And what happened next?”[2724] [13]
[2725] “We went on with the begonias, sir.”[2726] [13]
[2727] “Did not Mrs. Inglethorp call you again?”[2728] [13]
[2729] “Yes, sir, both me and Willum, she called.”[2730] [13]
[2731] “And then?”[2732] [13]
[2733] “She made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long[2734] paper—under where she’d signed.”[2735] [13]
[2736] “Did you see anything of what was written above her signature?” asked[2737] Poirot sharply.[2738] [13]
[2739] “No, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.”[2740] [13]
[2741] “And you signed where she told you?”[2742] [13]
[2743] “Yes, sir, first me and then Willum.”[2744] [13]
[2745] “What did she do with it afterwards?”[2746] [13]
[2747] “Well, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a[2748] sort of purple box that was standing on the desk.”[2749] [13]
[2750] “What time was it when she first called you?”[2751] [13]
[2752] “About four, I should say, sir.”[2753] [13]
[2754] “Not earlier? Couldn’t it have been about half-past three?”[2755] [13]
[2756] “No, I shouldn’t say so, sir. It would be more likely to be a bit after[2757] four—not before it.”[2758] [13]
[2759] “Thank you, Manning, that will do,” said Poirot pleasantly.[2760] [13]
[2761] The gardener glanced at his master, who nodded, whereupon Manning[2762] lifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble, and backed[2763] cautiously out of the window.[2764] [13]
[2765] We all looked at each other.[2766] [13]
[2767] “Good heavens!” murmured John. “What an extraordinary coincidence.”[2768] [13]
[2769] “How—a coincidence?”[2770] [13]
[2771] “That my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death!”[2772] [13]
[2773] Mr. Wells cleared his throat and remarked drily:[2774] [13]
[2775] “Are you so sure it is a coincidence, Cavendish?”[2776] [13]
[2777] “What do you mean?”[2778] [13]
[2779] “Your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with—someone yesterday[2780] afternoon——”[2781] [13]
[2782] “What do you mean?” cried John again. There was a tremor in his voice,[2783] and he had gone very pale.[2784] [13]
[2785] “In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and[2786] hurriedly makes a new will. The contents of that will we shall never[2787] know. She told no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she[2788] would have consulted me on the subject—but she had no chance. The will[2789] disappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. Cavendish,[2790] I much fear there is no coincidence there. Monsieur Poirot, I am sure[2791] you agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.”[2792] [13]
[2793] “Suggestive, or not,” interrupted John, “we are most grateful to[2794] Monsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter. But for him, we should[2795] never have known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur,[2796] what first led you to suspect the fact?”[2797] [13]
[2798] Poirot smiled and answered:[2799] [13]
[2800] “A scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.”[2801] [13]
[2802] John, I think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that[2803] moment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the[2804] window as it swept past.[2805] [13]
[2806] “Evie!” cried John. “Excuse me, Wells.” He went hurriedly out into the[2807] hall.[2808] [13]
[2809] Poirot looked inquiringly at me.[2810] [13]
[2811] “Miss Howard,” I explained.[2812] [13]
[2813] “Ah, I am glad she has come. There is a woman with a head and a heart[2814] too, Hastings. Though the good God gave her no beauty!”[2815] [13]
[2816] I followed John’s example, and went out into the hall, where Miss[2817] Howard was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass[2818] of veils that enveloped her head. As her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang[2819] of guilt shot through me. This was the woman who had warned me so[2820] earnestly, and to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed! How soon,[2821] and how contemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind. Now that she[2822] had been proved justified in so tragic a manner, I felt ashamed. She[2823] had known Alfred Inglethorp only too well. I wondered whether, if she[2824] had remained at Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would[2825] the man have feared her watchful eyes?[2826] [13]
[2827] I was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered[2828] painful grip. The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful;[2829] that she had been crying bitterly, I could tell by the redness of her[2830] eyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness.[2831] [13]
[2832] “Started the moment I got the wire. Just come off night duty. Hired[2833] car. Quickest way to get here.”[2834] [13]
[2835] “Have you had anything to eat this morning, Evie?” asked John.[2836] [13]
[2837] “No.”[2838] [13]
[2839] “I thought not. Come along, breakfast’s not cleared away yet, and[2840] they’ll make you some fresh tea.” He turned to me. “Look after her,[2841] Hastings, will you? Wells is waiting for me. Oh, here’s Monsieur[2842] Poirot. He’s helping us, you know, Evie.”[2843] [13]
[2844] Miss Howard shook hands with Poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her[2845] shoulder at John.[2846] [13]
[2847] “What do you mean—helping us?”[2848] [13]
[2849] “Helping us to investigate.”[2850] [13]
[2851] “Nothing to investigate. Have they taken him to prison yet?”[2852] [13]
[2853] “Taken who to prison?”[2854] [13]
[2855] “Who? Alfred Inglethorp, of course!”[2856] [13]
[2857] “My dear Evie, do be careful. Lawrence is of the opinion that my mother[2858] died from heart seizure.”[2859] [13]
[2860] “More fool, Lawrence!” retorted Miss Howard. “Of course Alfred[2861] Inglethorp murdered poor Emily—as I always told you he would.”[2862] [13]
[2863] “My dear Evie, don’t shout so. Whatever we may think or suspect, it is[2864] better to say as little as possible for the present. The inquest isn’t[2865] until Friday.”[2866] [13]
[2867] “Not until fiddlesticks!” The snort Miss Howard gave was truly[2868] magnificent. “You’re all off your heads. The man will be out of the[2869] country by then. If he’s any sense, he won’t stay here tamely and wait[2870] to be hanged.”[2871] [13]
[2872] John Cavendish looked at her helplessly.[2873] [13]
[2874] “I know what it is,” she accused him, “you’ve been listening to the[2875] doctors. Never should. What do they know? Nothing at all—or just enough[2876] to make them dangerous. I ought to know—my own father was a doctor.[2877] That little Wilkins is about the greatest fool that even I have ever[2878] seen. Heart seizure! Sort of thing he would say. Anyone with any sense[2879] could see at once that her husband had poisoned her. I always said he’d[2880] murder her in her bed, poor soul. Now he’s done it. And all you can do[2881] is to murmur silly things about ‘heart seizure’ and ‘inquest on[2882] Friday.’ You ought to be ashamed of yourself, John Cavendish.”[2883] [13]
[2884] “What do you want me to do?” asked John, unable to help a faint smile.[2885] “Dash it all, Evie, I can’t haul him down to the local police station[2886] by the scruff of his neck.”[2887] [13]
[2888] “Well, you might do something. Find out how he did it. He’s a crafty[2889] beggar. Dare say he soaked fly papers. Ask cook if she’s missed any.”[2890] [13]
[2891] It occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour Miss[2892] Howard and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace[2893] between them, was likely to prove a Herculean task, and I did not envy[2894] John. I could see by the expression of his face that he fully[2895] appreciated the difficulty of the position. For the moment, he sought[2896] refuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately.[2897] [13]
[2898] Dorcas brought in fresh tea. As she left the room, Poirot came over[2899] from the window where he had been standing, and sat down facing Miss[2900] Howard.[2901] [13]
[2902] “Mademoiselle,” he said gravely, “I want to ask you something.”[2903] [13]
[2904] “Ask away,” said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour.[2905] [13]
[2906] “I want to be able to count upon your help.”[2907] [13]
[2908] “I’ll help you to hang Alfred with pleasure,” she replied gruffly.[2909] “Hanging’s too good for him. Ought to be drawn and quartered, like in[2910] good old times.”[2911] [13]
[2912] “We are at one then,” said Poirot, “for I, too, want to hang the[2913] criminal.”[2914] [13]
[2915] “Alfred Inglethorp?”[2916] [13]
[2917] “Him, or another.”[2918] [13]
[2919] “No question of another. Poor Emily was never murdered until _he_ came[2920] along. I don’t say she wasn’t surrounded by sharks—she was. But it was[2921] only her purse they were after. Her life was safe enough. But along[2922] comes Mr. Alfred Inglethorp—and within two months—hey presto!”[2923] [13]
[2924] “Believe me, Miss Howard,” said Poirot very earnestly, “if Mr.[2925] Inglethorp is the man, he shall not escape me. On my honour, I will[2926] hang him as high as Haman!”[2927] [13]
[2928] “That’s better,” said Miss Howard more enthusiastically.[2929] [13]
[2930] “But I must ask you to trust me. Now your help may be very valuable to[2931] me. I will tell you why. Because, in all this house of mourning, yours[2932] are the only eyes that have wept.”[2933] [13]
[2934] Miss Howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her[2935] voice.[2936] [13]
[2937] “If you mean that I was fond of her—yes, I was. You know, Emily was a[2938] selfish old woman in her way. She was very generous, but she always[2939] wanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for[2940] them—and, that way she missed love. Don’t think she ever realized it,[2941] though, or felt the lack of it. Hope not, anyway. I was on a different[2942] footing. I took my stand from the first. ‘So many pounds a year I’m[2943] worth to you. Well and good. But not a penny piece besides—not a pair[2944] of gloves, nor a theatre ticket.’ She didn’t understand—was very[2945] offended sometimes. Said I was foolishly proud. It wasn’t that—but I[2946] couldn’t explain. Anyway, I kept my self-respect. And so, out of the[2947] whole bunch, I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of[2948] her. I watched over her. I guarded her from the lot of them, and then a[2949] glib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotion[2950] go for nothing.”[2951] [13]
[2952] Poirot nodded sympathetically.[2953] [13]
[2954] “I understand, mademoiselle, I understand all you feel. It is most[2955] natural. You think that we are lukewarm—that we lack fire and[2956] energy—but trust me, it is not so.”[2957] [13]
[2958] John stuck his head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come up[2959] to Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, as he and Mr. Wells had finished looking[2960] through the desk in the boudoir.[2961] [13]
[2962] As we went up the stairs, John looked back to the dining-room door, and[2963] lowered his voice confidentially:[2964] [13]
[2965] “Look here, what’s going to happen when these two meet?”[2966] [13]
[2967] I shook my head helplessly.[2968] [13]
[2969] “I’ve told Mary to keep them apart if she can.”[2970] [13]
[2971] “Will she be able to do so?”[2972] [13]
[2973] “The Lord only knows. There’s one thing, Inglethorp himself won’t be[2974] too keen on meeting her.”[2975] [13]
[2976] “You’ve got the keys still, haven’t you, Poirot?” I asked, as we[2977] reached the door of the locked room.[2978] [13]
[2979] Taking the keys from Poirot, John unlocked it, and we all passed in.[2980] The lawyer went straight to the desk, and John followed him.[2981] [13]
[2982] “My mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, I[2983] believe,” he said.[2984] [13]
[2985] Poirot drew out the small bunch of keys.[2986] [13]
[2987] “Permit me. I locked it, out of precaution, this morning.”[2988] [13]
[2989] “But it’s not locked now.”[2990] [13]
[2991] “Impossible!”[2992] [13]
[2993] “See.” And John lifted the lid as he spoke.[2994] [13]
[2995] “_Milles tonnerres!_” cried Poirot, dumbfounded. “And I—who have both[2996] the keys in my pocket!” He flung himself upon the case. Suddenly he[2997] stiffened. “_Eh voilà une affaire!_ This lock has been forced.”[2998] [13]
[2999] “What?”[3000] [13]
[3001] Poirot laid down the case again.[3002] [13]
[3003] “But who forced it? Why should they? When? But the door was locked?”[3004] These exclamations burst from us disjointedly.[3005] [13]
[3006] Poirot answered them categorically—almost mechanically.[3007] [13]
[3008] “Who? That is the question. Why? Ah, if I only knew. When? Since I was[3009] here an hour ago. As to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary[3010] lock. Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it.”[3011] [13]
[3012] We stared at one another blankly. Poirot had walked over to the[3013] mantelpiece. He was outwardly calm, but I noticed his hands, which from[3014] long force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on[3015] the mantelpiece, were shaking violently.[3016] [13]
[3017] “See here, it was like this,” he said at last. “There was something in[3018] that case—some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still[3019] enough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime. It was vital[3020] to him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its[3021] significance appreciated. Therefore, he took the risk, the great risk,[3022] of coming in here. Finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it,[3023] thus betraying his presence. For him to take that risk, it must have[3024] been something of great importance.”[3025] [13]
[3026] “But what was it?”[3027] [13]
[3028] “Ah!” cried Poirot, with a gesture of anger. “That, I do not know! A[3029] document of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper[3030] Dorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon. And I—” his anger burst[3031] forth freely—“miserable animal that I am! I guessed nothing! I have[3032] behaved like an imbecile! I should never have left that case here. I[3033] should have carried it away with me. Ah, triple pig! And now it is[3034] gone. It is destroyed—but is it destroyed? Is there not yet a chance—we[3035] must leave no stone unturned—”[3036] [13]
[3037] He rushed like a madman from the room, and I followed him as soon as I[3038] had sufficiently recovered my wits. But, by the time I had reached the[3039] top of the stairs, he was out of sight.[3040] [13]
[3041] Mary Cavendish was standing where the staircase branched, staring down[3042] into the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared.[3043] [13]
[3044] “What has happened to your extraordinary little friend, Mr. Hastings?[3045] He has just rushed past me like a mad bull.”[3046] [13]
[3047] “He’s rather upset about something,” I remarked feebly. I really did[3048] not know how much Poirot would wish me to disclose. As I saw a faint[3049] smile gather on Mrs. Cavendish’s expressive mouth, I endeavoured to try[3050] and turn the conversation by saying: “They haven’t met yet, have they?”[3051] [13]
[3052] “Who?”[3053] [13]
[3054] “Mr. Inglethorp and Miss Howard.”[3055] [13]
[3056] She looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner.[3057] [13]
[3058] “Do you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet?”[3059] [13]
[3060] “Well, don’t you?” I said, rather taken aback.[3061] [13]
[3062] “No.” She was smiling in her quiet way. “I should like to see a good[3063] flare up. It would clear the air. At present we are all thinking so[3064] much, and saying so little.”[3065] [13]
[3066] “John doesn’t think so,” I remarked. “He’s anxious to keep them apart.”[3067] [13]
[3068] “Oh, John!”[3069] [13]
[3070] Something in her tone fired me, and I blurted out:[3071] [13]
[3072] “Old John’s an awfully good sort.”[3073] [13]
[3074] She studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my[3075] great surprise:[3076] [13]
[3077] “You are loyal to your friend. I like you for that.”[3078] [13]
[3079] “Aren’t you my friend too?”[3080] [13]
[3081] “I am a very bad friend.”[3082] [13]
[3083] “Why do you say that?”[3084] [13]
[3085] “Because it is true. I am charming to my friends one day, and forget[3086] all about them the next.”[3087] [13]
[3088] I don’t know what impelled me, but I was nettled, and I said foolishly[3089] and not in the best of taste:[3090] [13]
[3091] “Yet you seem to be invariably charming to Dr. Bauerstein!”[3092] [13]
[3093] Instantly I regretted my words. Her face stiffened. I had the[3094] impression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real[3095] woman. Without a word, she turned and went swiftly up the stairs,[3096] whilst I stood like an idiot gaping after her.[3097] [13]
[3098] I was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. I[3099] could hear Poirot shouting and expounding. I was vexed to think that my[3100] diplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking the[3101] whole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one,[3102] doubted the wisdom. Once again I could not help regretting that my[3103] friend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement. I[3104] stepped briskly down the stairs. The sight of me calmed Poirot almost[3105] immediately. I drew him aside.[3106] [13]
[3107] “My dear fellow,” I said, “is this wise? Surely you don’t want the[3108] whole house to know of this occurrence? You are actually playing into[3109] the criminal’s hands.”[3110] [13]
[3111] “You think so, Hastings?”[3112] [13]
[3113] “I am sure of it.”[3114] [13]
[3115] “Well, well, my friend, I will be guided by you.”[3116] [13]
[3117] “Good. Although, unfortunately, it is a little too late now.”[3118] [13]
[3119] “Sure.”[3120] [13]
[3121] He looked so crestfallen and abashed that I felt quite sorry, though I[3122] still thought my rebuke a just and wise one.[3123] [13]
[3124] “Well,” he said at last, “let us go, _mon ami_.”[3125] [13]
[3126] “You have finished here?”[3127] [13]
[3128] “For the moment, yes. You will walk back with me to the village?”[3129] [13]
[3130] “Willingly.”[3131] [13]
[3132] He picked up his little suit-case, and we went out through the open[3133] window in the drawing-room. Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in, and[3134] Poirot stood aside to let her pass.[3135] [13]
[3136] “Excuse me, mademoiselle, one minute.”[3137] [13]
[3138] “Yes?” she turned inquiringly.[3139] [13]
[3140] “Did you ever make up Mrs. Inglethorp’s medicines?”[3141] [13]
[3142] A slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly:[3143] [13]
[3144] “No.”[3145] [13]
[3146] “Only her powders?”[3147] [13]
[3148] The flush deepened as Cynthia replied:[3149] [13]
[3150] “Oh, yes, I did make up some sleeping powders for her once.”[3151] [13]
[3152] “These?”[3153] [13]
[3154] Poirot produced the empty box which had contained powders.[3155] [13]
[3156] She nodded.[3157] [13]
[3158] “Can you tell me what they were? Sulphonal? Veronal?”[3159] [13]
[3160] “No, they were bromide powders.”[3161] [13]
[3162] “Ah! Thank you, mademoiselle; good morning.”[3163] [13]
[3164] As we walked briskly away from the house, I glanced at him more than[3165] once. I had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his[3166] eyes turned green like a cat’s. They were shining like emeralds now.[3167] [13]
[3168] “My friend,” he broke out at last, “I have a little idea, a very[3169] strange, and probably utterly impossible idea. And yet—it fits in.”[3170] [13]
[3171] I shrugged my shoulders. I privately thought that Poirot was rather too[3172] much given to these fantastic ideas. In this case, surely, the truth[3173] was only too plain and apparent.[3174] [13]
[3175] “So that is the explanation of the blank label on the box,” I remarked.[3176] “Very simple, as you said. I really wonder that I did not think of it[3177] myself.”[3178] [13]
[3179] Poirot did not appear to be listening to me.[3180] [13]
[3181] “They have made one more discovery, _là-bas_,” he observed, jerking his[3182] thumb over his shoulder in the direction of Styles. “Mr. Wells told me[3183] as we were going upstairs.”[3184] [13]
[3185] “What was it?”[3186] [13]
[3187] “Locked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of Mrs.[3188] Inglethorp’s, dated before her marriage, leaving her fortune to Alfred[3189] Inglethorp. It must have been made just at the time they were engaged.[3190] It came quite as a surprise to Wells—and to John Cavendish also. It was[3191] written on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the[3192] servants—not Dorcas.”[3193] [13]
[3194] “Did Mr. Inglethorp know of it?”[3195] [13]
[3196] “He says not.”[3197] [13]
[3198] “One might take that with a grain of salt,” I remarked sceptically.[3199] “All these wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled[3200] words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made[3201] yesterday afternoon?”[3202] [13]
[3203] Poirot smiled.[3204] [13]
[3205] “_Mon ami_, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the[3206] fact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?”[3207] [13]
[3208] “Yes, often. I suppose everyone has.”[3209] [13]
[3210] “Exactly. And have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or[3211] twice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to[3212] see if it looked right? Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You[3213] will notice that the word ‘possessed’ is spelt first with one ‘s’ and[3214] subsequently with two—correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it[3215] in a sentence, thus: ‘I am possessed.’ Now, what did that tell me? It[3216] told me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word ‘possessed’ that[3217] afternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh[3218] in my mind, the possibility of a will—(a document almost certain to[3219] contain that word)—occurred to me at once. This possibility was[3220] confirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the[3221] boudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several[3222] traces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine[3223] for some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy[3224] deposit.[3225] [13]
[3226] “I strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had[3227] been newly planted. The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that[3228] on the floor of the boudoir, and also I learnt from you that they _had_[3229] been planted yesterday afternoon. I was now sure that one, or possibly[3230] both of the gardeners—for there were two sets of footprints in the[3231] bed—had entered the boudoir, for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished[3232] to speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window,[3233] and they would not have come into the room at all. I was now quite[3234] convinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two[3235] gardeners in to witness her signature. Events proved that I was right[3236] in my supposition.”[3237] [13]
[3238] “That was very ingenious,” I could not help admitting. “I must confess[3239] that the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite[3240] erroneous.”[3241] [13]
[3242] He smiled.[3243] [13]
[3244] “You gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good[3245] servant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most[3246] likely.”[3247] [13]
[3248] “Another point—how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had[3249] been lost?”[3250] [13]
[3251] “I did not know it. It was a guess that turned out to be correct. You[3252] observed that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. That[3253] suggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy[3254] key-ring. Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would[3255] at once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch I found what[3256] was obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to[3257] the hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the[3258] lock of the despatch-case.”[3259] [13]
[3260] “Yes,” I said, “Alfred Inglethorp, without doubt.”[3261] [13]
[3262] Poirot looked at me curiously.[3263] [13]
[3264] “You are very sure of his guilt?”[3265] [13]
[3266] “Well, naturally. Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more[3267] clearly.”[3268] [13]
[3269] “On the contrary,” said Poirot quietly, “there are several points in[3270] his favour.”[3271] [13]
[3272] “Oh, come now!”[3273] [13]
[3274] “Yes.”[3275] [13]
[3276] “I see only one.”[3277] [13]
[3278] “And that?”[3279] [13]
[3280] “That he was not in the house last night.”[3281] [13]
[3282] “‘Bad shot!’ as you English say! You have chosen the one point that to[3283] my mind tells against him.”[3284] [13]
[3285] “How is that?”[3286] [13]
[3287] “Because if Mr. Inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last[3288] night, he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house. His[3289] excuse was an obviously trumped up one. That leaves us two[3290] possibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a[3291] reason of his own for his absence.”[3292] [13]
[3293] “And that reason?” I asked sceptically.[3294] [13]
[3295] Poirot shrugged his shoulders.[3296] [13]
[3297] “How should I know? Discreditable, without doubt. This Mr. Inglethorp,[3298] I should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel—but that does not of necessity[3299] make him a murderer.”[3300] [13]
[3301] I shook my head, unconvinced.[3302] [13]
[3303] “We do not agree, eh?” said Poirot. “Well, let us leave it. Time will[3304] show which of us is right. Now let us turn to other aspects of the[3305] case. What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom[3306] were bolted on the inside?”[3307] [13]
[3308] “Well——” I considered. “One must look at it logically.”[3309] [13]
[3310] “True.”[3311] [13]
[3312] “I should put it this way. The doors _were_ bolted—our own eyes have[3313] told us that—yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and[3314] the destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone[3315] entered the room. You agree so far?”[3316] [13]
[3317] “Perfectly. Put with admirable clearness. Proceed.”[3318] [13]
[3319] “Well,” I said, encouraged, “as the person who entered did not do so by[3320] the window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have[3321] been opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself. That strengthens[3322] the conviction that the person in question was her husband. She would[3323] naturally open the door to her own husband.”[3324] [13]
[3325] Poirot shook his head.[3326] [13]
[3327] “Why should she? She had bolted the door leading into his room—a most[3328] unusual proceeding on her part—she had had a most violent quarrel with[3329] him that very afternoon. No, he was the last person she would admit.”[3330] [13]
[3331] “But you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs.[3332] Inglethorp herself?”[3333] [13]
[3334] “There is another possibility. She may have forgotten to bolt the door[3335] into the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards[3336] morning, and bolted it then.”[3337] [13]
[3338] “Poirot, is that seriously your opinion?”[3339] [13]
[3340] “No, I do not say it is so, but it might be. Now, to turn to another[3341] feature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard[3342] between Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law?”[3343] [13]
[3344] “I had forgotten that,” I said thoughtfully. “That is as enigmatical as[3345] ever. It seems incredible that a woman like Mrs. Cavendish, proud and[3346] reticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was[3347] certainly not her affair.”[3348] [13]
[3349] “Precisely. It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to[3350] do.”[3351] [13]
[3352] “It is certainly curious,” I agreed. “Still, it is unimportant, and[3353] need not be taken into account.”[3354] [13]
[3355] A groan burst from Poirot.[3356] [13]
[3357] “What have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If[3358] the fact will not fit the theory—let the theory go.”[3359] [13]
[3360] “Well, we shall see,” I said, nettled.[3361] [13]
[3362] “Yes, we shall see.”[3363] [13]
[3364] We had reached Leastways Cottage, and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his[3365] own room. He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself[3366] occasionally smoked. I was amused to notice that he stowed away the[3367] used matches most carefully in a little china pot. My momentary[3368] annoyance vanished.[3369] [13]
[3370] Poirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which[3371] commanded a view of the village street. The fresh air blew in warm and[3372] pleasant. It was going to be a hot day.[3373] [13]
[3374] Suddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing[3375] down the street at a great pace. It was the expression on his face that[3376] was extraordinary—a curious mingling of terror and agitation.[3377] [13]
[3378] “Look, Poirot!” I said.[3379] [13]
[3380] He leant forward.[3381] [13]
[3382] “_Tiens!_” he said. “It is Mr. Mace, from the chemist’s shop. He is[3383] coming here.”[3384] [13]
[3385] The young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage, and, after[3386] hesitating a moment, pounded vigorously at the door.[3387] [13]
[3388] “A little minute,” cried Poirot from the window. “I come.”[3389] [13]
[3390] Motioning to me to follow him, he ran swiftly down the stairs and[3391] opened the door. Mr. Mace began at once.[3392] [13]
[3393] “Oh, Mr. Poirot, I’m sorry for the inconvenience, but I heard that[3394] you’d just come back from the Hall?”[3395] [13]
[3396] “Yes, we have.”[3397] [13]
[3398] The young man moistened his dry lips. His face was working curiously.[3399] [13]
[3400] “It’s all over the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly.[3401] They do say—” he lowered his voice cautiously—“that it’s poison?”[3402] [13]
[3403] Poirot’s face remained quite impassive.[3404] [13]
[3405] “Only the doctors can tell us that, Mr. Mace.”[3406] [13]
[3407] “Yes, exactly—of course——” The young man hesitated, and then his[3408] agitation was too much for him. He clutched Poirot by the arm, and sank[3409] his voice to a whisper: “Just tell me this, Mr. Poirot, it isn’t—it[3410] isn’t strychnine, is it?”[3411] [13]
[3412] I hardly heard what Poirot replied. Something evidently of a[3413] non-committal nature. The young man departed, and as he closed the door[3414] Poirot’s eyes met mine.[3415] [13]
[3416] “Yes,” he said, nodding gravely. “He will have evidence to give at the[3417] inquest.”[3418] [13]
[3419] We went slowly upstairs again. I was opening my lips, when Poirot[3420] stopped me with a gesture of his hand.[3421] [13]
[3422] “Not now, not now, _mon ami_. I have need of reflection. My mind is in[3423] some disorder—which is not well.”[3424] [13]
[3425] For about ten minutes he sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except[3426] for several expressive motions of his eyebrows, and all the time his[3427] eyes grew steadily greener. At last he heaved a deep sigh.[3428] [13]
[3429] “It is well. The bad moment has passed. Now all is arranged and[3430] classified. One must never permit confusion. The case is not clear[3431] yet—no. For it is of the most complicated! It puzzles _me_. _Me_,[3432] Hercule Poirot! There are two facts of significance.”[3433] [13]
[3434] “And what are they?”[3435] [13]
[3436] “The first is the state of the weather yesterday. That is very[3437] important.”[3438] [13]
[3439] “But it was a glorious day!” I interrupted. “Poirot, you’re pulling my[3440] leg!”[3441] [13]
[3442] “Not at all. The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. Do not[3443] forget that, my friend. It is the key to the whole riddle!”[3444] [13]
[3445] “And the second point?” I asked.[3446] [13]
[3447] “The important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar[3448] clothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.”[3449] [13]
[3450] “Poirot, I cannot believe you are serious.”[3451] [13]
[3452] “I am absolutely serious, my friend.”[3453] [13]
[3454] “But this is childish!”[3455] [13]
[3456] “No, it is very momentous.”[3457] [13]
[3458] “And supposing the Coroner’s jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder[3459] against Alfred Inglethorp. What becomes of your theories, then?”[3460] [13]
[3461] “They would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to[3462] make a mistake! But that will not occur. For one thing, a country jury[3463] is not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and Mr. Inglethorp[3464] stands practically in the position of local squire. Also,” he added[3465] placidly, “_I_ should not allow it!”[3466] [13]
[3467] “_You_ would not allow it?”[3468] [13]
[3469] “No.”[3470] [13]
[3471] I looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and[3472] amusement. He was so tremendously sure of himself. As though he read my[3473] thoughts, he nodded gently.[3474] [13]
[3475] “Oh, yes, _mon ami_, I would do what I say.” He got up and laid his[3476] hand on my shoulder. His physiognomy underwent a complete change. Tears[3477] came into his eyes. “In all this, you see, I think of that poor Mrs.[3478] Inglethorp who is dead. She was not extravagantly loved—no. But she was[3479] very good to us Belgians—I owe her a debt.”[3480] [13]
[3481] I endeavoured to interrupt, but Poirot swept on.[3482] [13]
[3483] “Let me tell you this, Hastings. She would never forgive me if I let[3484] Alfred Inglethorp, her husband, be arrested _now_—when a word from me[3485] could save him!”[3486] [13]
[3487] [13]
[3488] [13]
[3489] [13]
[3490] CHAPTER VI.[3491] THE INQUEST[3492] [13]
[3493] [13]
[3494] In the interval before the inquest, Poirot was unfailing in his[3495] activity. Twice he was closeted with Mr. Wells. He also took long walks[3496] into the country. I rather resented his not taking me into his[3497] confidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was[3498] driving at.[3499] [13]
[3500] It occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at Raikes’s[3501] farm; so, finding him out when I called at Leastways Cottage on[3502] Wednesday evening, I walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet[3503] him. But there was no sign of him, and I hesitated to go right up to[3504] the farm itself. As I walked away, I met an aged rustic, who leered at[3505] me cunningly.[3506] [13]
[3507] “You’m from the Hall, bain’t you?” he asked.[3508] [13]
[3509] “Yes. I’m looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked[3510] this way.”[3511] [13]
[3512] “A little chap? As waves his hands when he talks? One of them Belgies[3513] from the village?”[3514] [13]
[3515] “Yes,” I said eagerly. “He has been here, then?”[3516] [13]
[3517] “Oh, ay, he’s been here, right enough. More’n once too. Friend of[3518] yours, is he? Ah, you gentlemen from the Hall—you’m a pretty lot!” And[3519] he leered more jocosely than ever.[3520] [13]
[3521] “Why, do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often?” I asked, as[3522] carelessly as I could.[3523] [13]
[3524] He winked at me knowingly.[3525] [13]
[3526] “_One_ does, mister. Naming no names, mind. And a very liberal[3527] gentleman too! Oh, thank you, sir, I’m sure.”[3528] [13]
[3529] I walked on sharply. Evelyn Howard had been right then, and I[3530] experienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as I thought of Alfred[3531] Inglethorp’s liberality with another woman’s money. Had that piquant[3532] gipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser[3533] mainspring of money? Probably a judicious mixture of both.[3534] [13]
[3535] On one point, Poirot seemed to have a curious obsession. He once or[3536] twice observed to me that he thought Dorcas must have made an error in[3537] fixing the time of the quarrel. He suggested to her repeatedly that it[3538] was four-thirty, and not four o’clock when she had heard the voices.[3539] [13]
[3540] But Dorcas was unshaken. Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed[3541] between the time when she had heard the voices and five o’clock, when[3542] she had taken tea to her mistress.[3543] [13]
[3544] The inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village.[3545] Poirot and I sat together, not being required to give evidence.[3546] [13]
[3547] The preliminaries were gone through. The jury viewed the body, and John[3548] Cavendish gave evidence of identification.[3549] [13]
[3550] Further questioned, he described his awakening in the early hours of[3551] the morning, and the circumstances of his mother’s death.[3552] [13]
[3553] The medical evidence was next taken. There was a breathless hush, and[3554] every eye was fixed on the famous London specialist, who was known to[3555] be one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of[3556] toxicology.[3557] [13]
[3558] In a few brief words, he summed up the result of the post-mortem. Shorn[3559] of its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact[3560] that Mrs. Inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine[3561] poisoning. Judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken not[3562] less than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one[3563] grain or slightly over.[3564] [13]
[3565] “Is it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident?”[3566] asked the Coroner.[3567] [13]
[3568] “I should consider it very unlikely. Strychnine is not used for[3569] domestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions[3570] placed on its sale.”[3571] [13]
[3572] “Does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison[3573] was administered?”[3574] [13]
[3575] “No.”[3576] [13]
[3577] “You arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins, I believe?”[3578] [13]
[3579] “That is so. The motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and I[3580] hurried there as fast as I could.”[3581] [13]
[3582] “Will you relate to us exactly what happened next?”[3583] [13]
[3584] “I entered Mrs. Inglethorp’s room. She was at that moment in a typical[3585] tetanic convulsion. She turned towards me, and gasped out:[3586] ‘Alfred—Alfred——’”[3587] [13]
[3588] “Could the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorp’s[3589] after-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband?”[3590] [13]
[3591] “Possibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action. The[3592] symptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed. It[3593] is retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to[3594] have been present in this case. I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the[3595] coffee after dinner about eight o’clock, whereas the symptoms did not[3596] manifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the[3597] face of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the[3598] evening.”[3599] [13]
[3600] “Mrs. Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the[3601] middle of the night. Could the strychnine have been administered in[3602] that?”[3603] [13]
[3604] “No, I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and[3605] had it analysed. There was no strychnine present.”[3606] [13]
[3607] I heard Poirot chuckle softly beside me.[3608] [13]
[3609] “How did you know?” I whispered.[3610] [13]
[3611] “Listen.”[3612] [13]
[3613] “I should say”—the doctor was continuing—“that I would have been[3614] considerably surprised at any other result.”[3615] [13]
[3616] “Why?”[3617] [13]
[3618] “Simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste. It can be[3619] detected in a solution of one in seventy thousand, and can only be[3620] disguised by some strongly flavoured substance. Cocoa would be quite[3621] powerless to mask it.”[3622] [13]
[3623] One of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee.[3624] [13]
[3625] “No. Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover[3626] the taste of strychnine.”[3627] [13]
[3628] “Then you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the[3629] coffee, but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed.”[3630] [13]
[3631] “Yes, but, the cup being completely smashed, there is no possibility of[3632] analyzing its contents.”[3633] [13]
[3634] This concluded Dr. Bauerstein’s evidence. Dr. Wilkins corroborated it[3635] on all points. Sounded as to the possibility of suicide, he repudiated[3636] it utterly. The deceased, he said, suffered from a weak heart, but[3637] otherwise enjoyed perfect health, and was of a cheerful and[3638] well-balanced disposition. She would be one of the last people to take[3639] her own life.[3640] [13]
[3641] Lawrence Cavendish was next called. His evidence was quite unimportant,[3642] being a mere repetition of that of his brother. Just as he was about to[3643] step down, he paused, and said rather hesitatingly:[3644] [13]
[3645] “I should like to make a suggestion if I may?”[3646] [13]
[3647] He glanced deprecatingly at the Coroner, who replied briskly:[3648] [13]
[3649] “Certainly, Mr. Cavendish, we are here to arrive at the truth of this[3650] matter, and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation.”[3651] [13]
[3652] “It is just an idea of mine,” explained Lawrence. “Of course I may be[3653] quite wrong, but it still seems to me that my mother’s death might be[3654] accounted for by natural means.”[3655] [13]
[3656] “How do you make that out, Mr. Cavendish?”[3657] [13]
[3658] “My mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was[3659] taking a tonic containing strychnine.”[3660] [13]
[3661] “Ah!” said the Coroner.[3662] [13]
[3663] The jury looked up, interested.[3664] [13]
[3665] “I believe,” continued Lawrence, “that there have been cases where the[3666] cumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by[3667] causing death. Also, is it not possible that she may have taken an[3668] overdose of her medicine by accident?”[3669] [13]
[3670] “This is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at[3671] the time of her death. We are much obliged to you, Mr. Cavendish.”[3672] [13]
[3673] Dr. Wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea.[3674] [13]
[3675] “What Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible. Any doctor would tell[3676] you the same. Strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison,[3677] but it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in[3678] this way. There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms[3679] which would at once have attracted my attention. The whole thing is[3680] absurd.”[3681] [13]
[3682] “And the second suggestion? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently[3683] taken an overdose?”[3684] [13]
[3685] “Three, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. Mrs.[3686] Inglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a[3687] time, as she dealt with Coot’s, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. She[3688] would have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the[3689] amount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.”[3690] [13]
[3691] “Then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any[3692] way instrumental in causing her death?”[3693] [13]
[3694] “Certainly. The supposition is ridiculous.”[3695] [13]
[3696] The same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the[3697] chemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error.[3698] [13]
[3699] “That, of course, is always possible,” replied the doctor.[3700] [13]
[3701] But Dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that[3702] possibility. The medicine had not been newly made up. On the contrary,[3703] Mrs. Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death.[3704] [13]
[3705] So the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the Coroner[3706] proceeded with his task. Having elicited from Dorcas how she had been[3707] awakened by the violent ringing of her mistress’s bell, and had[3708] subsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the[3709] quarrel on the preceding afternoon.[3710] [13]
[3711] Dorcas’s evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had[3712] already heard, so I will not repeat it here.[3713] [13]
[3714] The next witness was Mary Cavendish. She stood very upright, and spoke[3715] in a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice. In answer to the[3716] Coroner’s question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at[3717] four-thirty as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the[3718] sound of something heavy falling.[3719] [13]
[3720] “That would have been the table by the bed?” commented the Coroner.[3721] [13]
[3722] “I opened my door,” continued Mary, “and listened. In a few minutes a[3723] bell rang violently. Dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and[3724] we all went to my mother-in-law’s room, but it was locked——”[3725] [13]
[3726] The Coroner interrupted her.[3727] [13]
[3728] “I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point. We[3729] know all that can be known of the subsequent happenings. But I should[3730] be obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the[3731] day before.”[3732] [13]
[3733] “I?”[3734] [13]
[3735] There was a faint insolence in her voice. She raised her hand and[3736] adjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck, turning her head a little as[3737] she did so. And quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind:[3738] “She is gaining time!”[3739] [13]
[3740] “Yes. I understand,” continued the Coroner deliberately, “that you were[3741] sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the[3742] boudoir. That is so, is it not?”[3743] [13]
[3744] This was news to me and glancing sideways at Poirot, I fancied that it[3745] was news to him as well.[3746] [13]
[3747] There was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before[3748] she answered:[3749] [13]
[3750] “Yes, that is so.”[3751] [13]
[3752] “And the boudoir window was open, was it not?”[3753] [13]
[3754] Surely her face grew a little paler as she answered:[3755] [13]
[3756] “Yes.”[3757] [13]
[3758] “Then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as[3759] they were raised in anger. In fact, they would be more audible where[3760] you were than in the hall.”[3761] [13]
[3762] “Possibly.”[3763] [13]
[3764] “Will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel?”[3765] [13]
[3766] “I really do not remember hearing anything.”[3767] [13]
[3768] “Do you mean to say you did not hear voices?”[3769] [13]
[3770] “Oh, yes, I heard the voices, but I did not hear what they said.” A[3771] faint spot of colour came into her cheek. “I am not in the habit of[3772] listening to private conversations.”[3773] [13]
[3774] The Coroner persisted.[3775] [13]
[3776] “And you remember nothing at all? _Nothing_, Mrs. Cavendish? Not one[3777] stray word or phrase to make you realize that it _was_ a private[3778] conversation?”[3779] [13]
[3780] She paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever.[3781] [13]
[3782] “Yes; I remember. Mrs. Inglethorp said something—I do not remember[3783] exactly what—about causing scandal between husband and wife.”[3784] [13]
[3785] “Ah!” the Coroner leant back satisfied. “That corresponds with what[3786] Dorcas heard. But excuse me, Mrs. Cavendish, although you realized it[3787] was a private conversation, you did not move away? You remained where[3788] you were?”[3789] [13]
[3790] I caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them. I[3791] felt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the[3792] little lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied[3793] quietly enough:[3794] [13]
[3795] “No. I was very comfortable where I was. I fixed my mind on my book.”[3796] [13]
[3797] “And that is all you can tell us?”[3798] [13]
[3799] “That is all.”[3800] [13]
[3801] The examination was over, though I doubted if the Coroner was entirely[3802] satisfied with it. I think he suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell[3803] more if she chose.[3804] [13]
[3805] Amy Hill, shop assistant, was next called, and deposed to having sold a[3806] will form on the afternoon of the 17th to William Earl, under-gardener[3807] at Styles.[3808] [13]
[3809] William Earl and Manning succeeded her, and testified to witnessing a[3810] document. Manning fixed the time at about four-thirty, William was of[3811] the opinion that it was rather earlier.[3812] [13]
[3813] Cynthia Murdoch came next. She had, however, little to tell. She had[3814] known nothing of the tragedy, until awakened by Mrs. Cavendish.[3815] [13]
[3816] “You did not hear the table fall?”[3817] [13]
[3818] “No. I was fast asleep.”[3819] [13]
[3820] The Coroner smiled.[3821] [13]
[3822] “A good conscience makes a sound sleeper,” he observed. “Thank you,[3823] Miss Murdoch, that is all.”[3824] [13]
[3825] “Miss Howard.”[3826] [13]
[3827] Miss Howard produced the letter written to her by Mrs. Inglethorp on[3828] the evening of the 17th. Poirot and I had, of course already seen it.[3829] It added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy. The following is a[3830] facsimile:[3831] [13]
[3832] STYLES COURT[3833] ESSEX[3834] hand written note:[3835] [13]
[3836]      July 17th[3837]      My dear Evelyn[3838]      Can we not bury[3839]      the hachet? I have[3840]      found it hard to forgive[3841]      the things you said[3842]      against my dear husband[3843]      but I am an old woman[3844]      & very fond of you[3845]      Yours affectionately,[3846]     Emily Inglethorpe[3847] [13]
[3848] [13]
[3849] It was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively.[3850] [13]
[3851] “I fear it does not help us much,” said the Coroner, with a sigh.[3852] “There is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon.”[3853] [13]
[3854] “Plain as a pikestaff to me,” said Miss Howard shortly. “It shows[3855] clearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she’d been[3856] made a fool of!”[3857] [13]
[3858] “It says nothing of the kind in the letter,” the Coroner pointed out.[3859] [13]
[3860] “No, because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong. But[3861] _I_ know her. She wanted me back. But she wasn’t going to own that I’d[3862] been right. She went round about. Most people do. Don’t believe in it[3863] myself.”[3864] [13]
[3865] Mr. Wells smiled faintly. So, I noticed, did several of the jury. Miss[3866] Howard was obviously quite a public character.[3867] [13]
[3868] “Anyway, all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time,” continued the[3869] lady, glancing up and down the jury disparagingly. “Talk—talk—talk![3870] When all the time we know perfectly well——”[3871] [13]
[3872] The Coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension:[3873] [13]
[3874] “Thank you, Miss Howard, that is all.”[3875] [13]
[3876] I fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied.[3877] [13]
[3878] Then came the sensation of the day. The Coroner called Albert Mace,[3879] chemist’s assistant.[3880] [13]
[3881] It was our agitated young man of the pale face. In answer to the[3882] Coroner’s questions, he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist,[3883] but had only recently come to this particular shop, as the assistant[3884] formerly there had just been called up for the army.[3885] [13]
[3886] These preliminaries completed, the Coroner proceeded to business.[3887] [13]
[3888] “Mr. Mace, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person?”[3889] [13]
[3890] “Yes, sir.”[3891] [13]
[3892] “When was this?”[3893] [13]
[3894] “Last Monday night.”[3895] [13]
[3896] “Monday? Not Tuesday?”[3897] [13]
[3898] “No, sir, Monday, the 16th.”[3899] [13]
[3900] “Will you tell us to whom you sold it?”[3901] [13]
[3902] You could have heard a pin drop.[3903] [13]
[3904] “Yes, sir. It was to Mr. Inglethorp.”[3905] [13]
[3906] Every eye turned simultaneously to where Alfred Inglethorp was sitting,[3907] impassive and wooden. He started slightly, as the damning words fell[3908] from the young man’s lips. I half thought he was going to rise from his[3909] chair, but he remained seated, although a remarkably well acted[3910] expression of astonishment rose on his face.[3911] [13]
[3912] “You are sure of what you say?” asked the Coroner sternly.[3913] [13]
[3914] “Quite sure, sir.”[3915] [13]
[3916] “Are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the[3917] counter?”[3918] [13]
[3919] The wretched young man wilted visibly under the Coroner’s frown.[3920] [13]
[3921] “Oh, no, sir—of course not. But, seeing it was Mr. Inglethorp of the[3922] Hall, I thought there was no harm in it. He said it was to poison a[3923] dog.”[3924] [13]
[3925] Inwardly I sympathized. It was only human nature to endeavour to please[3926] “The Hall”—especially when it might result in custom being transferred[3927] from Coot’s to the local establishment.[3928] [13]
[3929] “Is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?”[3930] [13]
[3931] “Yes, sir, Mr. Inglethorp did so.”[3932] [13]
[3933] “Have you got the book here?”[3934] [13]
[3935] “Yes, sir.”[3936] [13]
[3937] It was produced; and, with a few words of stern censure, the Coroner[3938] dismissed the wretched Mr. Mace.[3939] [13]
[3940] Then, amidst a breathless silence, Alfred Inglethorp was called. Did he[3941] realize, I wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his[3942] neck?[3943] [13]
[3944] The Coroner went straight to the point.[3945] [13]
[3946] “On Monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of[3947] poisoning a dog?”[3948] [13]
[3949] Inglethorp replied with perfect calmness:[3950] [13]
[3951] “No, I did not. There is no dog at Styles, except an outdoor sheepdog,[3952] which is in perfect health.”[3953] [13]
[3954] “You deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert Mace on[3955] Monday last?”[3956] [13]
[3957] “I do.”[3958] [13]
[3959] “Do you also deny _this_?”[3960] [13]
[3961] The Coroner handed him the register in which his signature was[3962] inscribed.[3963] [13]
[3964] “Certainly I do. The hand-writing is quite different from mine. I will[3965] show you.”[3966] [13]
[3967] He took an old envelope out of his pocket, and wrote his name on it,[3968] handing it to the jury. It was certainly utterly dissimilar.[3969] [13]
[3970] “Then what is your explanation of Mr. Mace’s statement?”[3971] [13]
[3972] Alfred Inglethorp replied imperturbably:[3973] [13]
[3974] “Mr. Mace must have been mistaken.”[3975] [13]
[3976] The Coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said:[3977] [13]
[3978] “Mr. Inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us[3979] where you were on the evening of Monday, July 16th?”[3980] [13]
[3981] “Really—I cannot remember.”[3982] [13]
[3983] “That is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp,” said the Coroner sharply. “Think[3984] again.”[3985] [13]
[3986] Inglethorp shook his head.[3987] [13]
[3988] “I cannot tell you. I have an idea that I was out walking.”[3989] [13]
[3990] “In what direction?”[3991] [13]
[3992] “I really can’t remember.”[3993] [13]
[3994] The Coroner’s face grew graver.[3995] [13]
[3996] “Were you in company with anyone?”[3997] [13]
[3998] “No.”[3999] [13]
[4000] “Did you meet anyone on your walk?”[4001] [13]
[4002] “No.”[4003] [13]
[4004] “That is a pity,” said the Coroner dryly. “I am to take it then that[4005] you decline to say where you were at the time that Mr. Mace positively[4006] recognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine?”[4007] [13]
[4008] “If you like to take it that way, yes.”[4009] [13]
[4010] “Be careful, Mr. Inglethorp.”[4011] [13]
[4012] Poirot was fidgeting nervously.[4013] [13]
[4014] “_Sacré!_” he murmured. “Does this imbecile of a man _want_ to be[4015] arrested?”[4016] [13]
[4017] Inglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression. His futile denials[4018] would not have convinced a child. The Coroner, however, passed briskly[4019] to the next point, and Poirot drew a deep breath of relief.[4020] [13]
[4021] “You had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon?”[4022] [13]
[4023] “Pardon me,” interrupted Alfred Inglethorp, “you have been misinformed.[4024] I had no quarrel with my dear wife. The whole story is absolutely[4025] untrue. I was absent from the house the entire afternoon.”[4026] [13]
[4027] “Have you anyone who can testify to that?”[4028] [13]
[4029] “You have my word,” said Inglethorp haughtily.[4030] [13]
[4031] The Coroner did not trouble to reply.[4032] [13]
[4033] “There are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your[4034] disagreement with Mrs. Inglethorp.”[4035] [13]
[4036] “Those witnesses were mistaken.”[4037] [13]
[4038] I was puzzled. The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was[4039] staggered. I looked at Poirot. There was an expression of exultation on[4040] his face which I could not understand. Was he at last convinced of[4041] Alfred Inglethorp’s guilt?[4042] [13]
[4043] “Mr. Inglethorp,” said the Coroner, “you have heard your wife’s dying[4044] words repeated here. Can you explain them in any way?”[4045] [13]
[4046] “Certainly I can.”[4047] [13]
[4048] “You can?”[4049] [13]
[4050] “It seems to me very simple. The room was dimly lighted. Dr. Bauerstein[4051] is much of my height and build, and, like me, wears a beard. In the dim[4052] light, and suffering as she was, my poor wife mistook him for me.”[4053] [13]
[4054] “Ah!” murmured Poirot to himself. “But it is an idea, that!”[4055] [13]
[4056] “You think it is true?” I whispered.[4057] [13]
[4058] “I do not say that. But it is truly an ingenious supposition.”[4059] [13]
[4060] “You read my wife’s last words as an accusation”—Inglethorp was[4061] continuing—“they were, on the contrary, an appeal to me.”[4062] [13]
[4063] The Coroner reflected a moment, then he said:[4064] [13]
[4065] “I believe, Mr. Inglethorp, that you yourself poured out the coffee,[4066] and took it to your wife that evening?”[4067] [13]
[4068] “I poured it out, yes. But I did not take it to her. I meant to do so,[4069] but I was told that a friend was at the hall door, so I laid down the[4070] coffee on the hall table. When I came through the hall again a few[4071] minutes later, it was gone.”[4072] [13]
[4073] This statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me[4074] to improve matters much for Inglethorp. In any case, he had had ample[4075] time to introduce the poison.[4076] [13]
[4077] At that point, Poirot nudged me gently, indicating two men who were[4078] sitting together near the door. One was a little, sharp, dark,[4079] ferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair.[4080] [13]
[4081] I questioned Poirot mutely. He put his lips to my ear.[4082] [13]
[4083] “Do you know who that little man is?”[4084] [13]
[4085] I shook my head.[4086] [13]
[4087] “That is Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard—Jimmy Japp.[4088] The other man is from Scotland Yard too. Things are moving quickly, my[4089] friend.”[4090] [13]
[4091] I stared at the two men intently. There was certainly nothing of the[4092] policeman about them. I should never have suspected them of being[4093] official personages.[4094] [13]
[4095] I was still staring, when I was startled and recalled by the verdict[4096] being given:[4097] [13]
[4098] “Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown.”[4099] [13]
[4100] [13]
[4101] [13]
[4102] [13]
[4103] CHAPTER VII.[4104] POIROT PAYS HIS DEBTS[4105] [13]
[4106] [13]
[4107] As we came out of the Stylites Arms, Poirot drew me aside by a gentle[4108] pressure of the arm. I understood his object. He was waiting for the[4109] Scotland Yard men.[4110] [13]
[4111] In a few moments, they emerged, and Poirot at once stepped forward, and[4112] accosted the shorter of the two.[4113] [13]
[4114] “I fear you do not remember me, Inspector Japp.”[4115] [13]
[4116] “Why, if it isn’t Mr. Poirot!” cried the Inspector. He turned to the[4117] other man. “You’ve heard me speak of Mr. Poirot? It was in 1904 he and[4118] I worked together—the Abercrombie forgery case—you remember, he was run[4119] down in Brussels. Ah, those were great days, moosier. Then, do you[4120] remember ‘Baron’ Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded[4121] the clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him in[4122] Antwerp—thanks to Mr. Poirot here.”[4123] [13]
[4124] As these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, I drew nearer,[4125] and was introduced to Detective-Inspector Japp, who, in his turn,[4126] introduced us both to his companion, Superintendent Summerhaye.[4127] [13]
[4128] “I need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen,” remarked[4129] Poirot.[4130] [13]
[4131] Japp closed one eye knowingly.[4132] [13]
[4133] “No, indeed. Pretty clear case I should say.”[4134] [13]
[4135] But Poirot answered gravely:[4136] [13]
[4137] “There I differ from you.”[4138] [13]
[4139] “Oh, come!” said Summerhaye, opening his lips for the first time.[4140] “Surely the whole thing is clear as daylight. The man’s caught[4141] red-handed. How he could be such a fool beats me!”[4142] [13]
[4143] But Japp was looking attentively at Poirot.[4144] [13]
[4145] “Hold your fire, Summerhaye,” he remarked jocularly. “Me and Moosier[4146] here have met before—and there’s no man’s judgment I’d sooner take than[4147] his. If I’m not greatly mistaken, he’s got something up his sleeve.[4148] Isn’t that so, moosier?”[4149] [13]
[4150] Poirot smiled.[4151] [13]
[4152] “I have drawn certain conclusions—yes.”[4153] [13]
[4154] Summerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but Japp continued his[4155] scrutiny of Poirot.[4156] [13]
[4157] “It’s this way,” he said, “so far, we’ve only seen the case from the[4158] outside. That’s where the Yard’s at a disadvantage in a case of this[4159] kind, where the murder’s only out, so to speak, after the inquest. A[4160] lot depends on being on the spot first thing, and that’s where Mr.[4161] Poirot’s had the start of us. We shouldn’t have been here as soon as[4162] this even, if it hadn’t been for the fact that there was a smart doctor[4163] on the spot, who gave us the tip through the Coroner. But you’ve been[4164] on the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little[4165] hints. From the evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his[4166] wife as sure as I stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary[4167] I’d laugh in his face. I must say I was surprised the jury didn’t bring[4168] it in Wilful Murder against him right off. I think they would have, if[4169] it hadn’t been for the Coroner—he seemed to be holding them back.”[4170] [13]
[4171] “Perhaps, though, you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket[4172] now,” suggested Poirot.[4173] [13]
[4174] A kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from Japp’s[4175] expressive countenance.[4176] [13]
[4177] “Perhaps I have, and perhaps I haven’t,” he remarked dryly.[4178] [13]
[4179] Poirot looked at him thoughtfully.[4180] [13]
[4181] “I am very anxious, Messieurs, that he should not be arrested.”[4182] [13]
[4183] “I dare say,” observed Summerhaye sarcastically.[4184] [13]
[4185] Japp was regarding Poirot with comical perplexity.[4186] [13]
[4187] “Can’t you go a little further, Mr. Poirot? A wink’s as good as a[4188] nod—from you. You’ve been on the spot—and the Yard doesn’t want to make[4189] any mistakes, you know.”[4190] [13]
[4191] Poirot nodded gravely.[4192] [13]
[4193] “That is exactly what I thought. Well, I will tell you this. Use your[4194] warrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp. But it will bring you no kudos—the case[4195] against him will be dismissed at once! _Comme ça!_” And he snapped his[4196] fingers expressively.[4197] [13]
[4198] Japp’s face grew grave, though Summerhaye gave an incredulous snort.[4199] [13]
[4200] As for me, I was literally dumb with astonishment. I could only[4201] conclude that Poirot was mad.[4202] [13]
[4203] Japp had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his brow.[4204] [13]
[4205] “I daren’t do it, Mr. Poirot. _I_’d take your word, but there’s others[4206] over me who’ll be asking what the devil I mean by it. Can’t you give me[4207] a little more to go on?”[4208] [13]
[4209] Poirot reflected a moment.[4210] [13]
[4211] “It can be done,” he said at last. “I admit I do not wish it. It forces[4212] my hand. I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the[4213] present, but what you say is very just—the word of a Belgian policeman,[4214] whose day is past, is not enough! And Alfred Inglethorp must not be[4215] arrested. That I have sworn, as my friend Hastings here knows. See,[4216] then, my good Japp, you go at once to Styles?”[4217] [13]
[4218] “Well, in about half an hour. We’re seeing the Coroner and the doctor[4219] first.”[4220] [13]
[4221] “Good. Call for me in passing—the last house in the village. I will go[4222] with you. At Styles, Mr. Inglethorp will give you, or if he refuses—as[4223] is probable—I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the[4224] case against him could not possibly be sustained. Is that a bargain?”[4225] [13]
[4226] “That’s a bargain,” said Japp heartily. “And, on behalf of the Yard,[4227] I’m much obliged to you, though I’m bound to confess I can’t at present[4228] see the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always[4229] were a marvel! So long, then, moosier.”[4230] [13]
[4231] The two detectives strode away, Summerhaye with an incredulous grin on[4232] his face.[4233] [13]
[4234] “Well, my friend,” cried Poirot, before I could get in a word, “what do[4235] you think? _Mon Dieu!_ I had some warm moments in that court; I did not[4236] figure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to[4237] say anything at all. Decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile.”[4238] [13]
[4239] “H’m! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility,” I[4240] remarked. “For, if the case against him is true, how could he defend[4241] himself except by silence?”[4242] [13]
[4243] “Why, in a thousand ingenious ways,” cried Poirot. “See; say that it is[4244] I who have committed this murder, I can think of seven most plausible[4245] stories! Far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorp’s stony denials!”[4246] [13]
[4247] I could not help laughing.[4248] [13]
[4249] “My dear Poirot, I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy! But,[4250] seriously, in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives, you[4251] surely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp’s[4252] innocence?”[4253] [13]
[4254] “Why not now as much as before? Nothing has changed.”[4255] [13]
[4256] “But the evidence is so conclusive.”[4257] [13]
[4258] “Yes, too conclusive.”[4259] [13]
[4260] We turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage, and proceeded up the now[4261] familiar stairs.[4262] [13]
[4263] “Yes, yes, too conclusive,” continued Poirot, almost to himself. “Real[4264] evidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. It has to be[4265] examined—sifted. But here the whole thing is cut and dried. No, my[4266] friend, this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured—so cleverly[4267] that it has defeated its own ends.”[4268] [13]
[4269] “How do you make that out?”[4270] [13]
[4271] “Because, so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible,[4272] it was very hard to disprove. But, in his anxiety, the criminal has[4273] drawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free.”[4274] [13]
[4275] I was silent. And in a minute or two, Poirot continued:[4276] [13]
[4277] “Let us look at the matter like this. Here is a man, let us say, who[4278] sets out to poison his wife. He has lived by his wits as the saying[4279] goes. Presumably, therefore, he has some wits. He is not altogether a[4280] fool. Well, how does he set about it? He goes boldly to the village[4281] chemist’s and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped[4282] up story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. He does not[4283] employ the poison that night. No, he waits until he has had a violent[4284] quarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which[4285] naturally directs their suspicions upon him. He prepares no defence—no[4286] shadow of an alibi, yet he knows the chemist’s assistant must[4287] necessarily come forward with the facts. Bah! Do not ask me to believe[4288] that any man could be so idiotic! Only a lunatic, who wished to commit[4289] suicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so!”[4290] [13]
[4291] “Still—I do not see——” I began.[4292] [13]
[4293] “Neither do I see. I tell you, _mon ami_, it puzzles me. _Me_—Hercule[4294] Poirot!”[4295] [13]
[4296] “But if you believe him innocent, how do you explain his buying the[4297] strychnine?”[4298] [13]
[4299] “Very simply. He did _not_ buy it.”[4300] [13]
[4301] “But Mace recognized him!”[4302] [13]
[4303] “I beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like Mr.[4304] Inglethorp’s, and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp, and dressed in[4305] Mr. Inglethorp’s rather noticeable clothes. He could not recognize a[4306] man whom he had probably only seen in the distance, since, you[4307] remember, he himself had only been in the village a fortnight, and Mrs.[4308] Inglethorp dealt principally with Coot’s in Tadminster.”[4309] [13]
[4310] “Then you think——”[4311] [13]
[4312] “_Mon ami_, do you remember the two points I laid stress upon? Leave[4313] the first one for the moment, what was the second?”[4314] [13]
[4315] “The important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has[4316] a black beard, and uses glasses,” I quoted.[4317] [13]
[4318] “Exactly. Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or[4319] Lawrence Cavendish. Would it be easy?”[4320] [13]
[4321] “No,” I said thoughtfully. “Of course an actor——”[4322] [13]
[4323] But Poirot cut me short ruthlessly.[4324] [13]
[4325] “And why would it not be easy? I will tell you, my friend: Because they[4326] are both clean-shaven men. To make up successfully as one of these two[4327] in broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain[4328] initial facial resemblance. But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp, all[4329] that is changed. His clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his[4330] eyes—those are the salient points about his personal appearance. Now,[4331] what is the first instinct of the criminal? To divert suspicion from[4332] himself, is it not so? And how can he best do that? By throwing it on[4333] someone else. In this instance, there was a man ready to his hand.[4334] Everybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp’s guilt. It was[4335] a foregone conclusion that he would be suspected; but, to make it a[4336] sure thing there must be tangible proof—such as the actual buying of[4337] the poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr.[4338] Inglethorp, was not difficult. Remember, this young Mace had never[4339] actually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp. How should he doubt that the man in[4340] his clothes, with his beard and his glasses, was not Alfred[4341] Inglethorp?”[4342] [13]
[4343] “It may be so,” I said, fascinated by Poirot’s eloquence. “But, if that[4344] was the case, why does he not say where he was at six o’clock on Monday[4345] evening?”[4346] [13]
[4347] “Ah, why indeed?” said Poirot, calming down. “If he were arrested, he[4348] probably would speak, but I do not want it to come to that. I must make[4349] him see the gravity of his position. There is, of course, something[4350] discreditable behind his silence. If he did not murder his wife, he is,[4351] nevertheless, a scoundrel, and has something of his own to conceal,[4352] quite apart from the murder.”[4353] [13]
[4354] “What can it be?” I mused, won over to Poirot’s views for the moment,[4355] although still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction[4356] was the correct one.[4357] [13]
[4358] “Can you not guess?” asked Poirot, smiling.[4359] [13]
[4360] “No, can you?”[4361] [13]
[4362] “Oh, yes, I had a little idea sometime ago—and it has turned out to be[4363] correct.”[4364] [13]
[4365] “You never told me,” I said reproachfully.[4366] [13]
[4367] Poirot spread out his hands apologetically.[4368] [13]
[4369] “Pardon me, _mon ami_, you were not precisely _sympathique_.” He turned[4370] to me earnestly. “Tell me—you see now that he must not be arrested?”[4371] [13]
[4372] “Perhaps,” I said doubtfully, for I was really quite indifferent to the[4373] fate of Alfred Inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him[4374] no harm.[4375] [13]
[4376] Poirot, who was watching me intently, gave a sigh.[4377] [13]
[4378] “Come, my friend,” he said, changing the subject, “apart from Mr.[4379] Inglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you?”[4380] [13]
[4381] “Oh, pretty much what I expected.”[4382] [13]
[4383] “Did nothing strike you as peculiar about it?”[4384] [13]
[4385] My thoughts flew to Mary Cavendish, and I hedged:[4386] [13]
[4387] “In what way?”[4388] [13]
[4389] “Well, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish’s evidence for instance?”[4390] [13]
[4391] I was relieved.[4392] [13]
[4393] “Oh, Lawrence! No, I don’t think so. He’s always a nervous chap.”[4394] [13]
[4395] “His suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally[4396] by means of the tonic she was taking, that did not strike you as[4397] strange— _hein?_”[4398] [13]
[4399] “No, I can’t say it did. The doctors ridiculed it of course. But it was[4400] quite a natural suggestion for a layman to make.”[4401] [13]
[4402] “But Monsieur Lawrence is not a layman. You told me yourself that he[4403] had started by studying medicine, and that he had taken his degree.”[4404] [13]
[4405] “Yes, that’s true. I never thought of that.” I was rather startled. “It[4406] _is_ odd.”[4407] [13]
[4408] Poirot nodded.[4409] [13]
[4410] “From the first, his behaviour has been peculiar. Of all the household,[4411] he alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine[4412] poisoning, and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold[4413] strenuously the theory of death from natural causes. If it had been[4414] Monsieur John, I could have understood it. He has no technical[4415] knowledge, and is by nature unimaginative. But Monsieur Lawrence—no![4416] And now, to-day, he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have[4417] known was ridiculous. There is food for thought in this, _mon ami!_”[4418] [13]
[4419] “It’s very confusing,” I agreed.[4420] [13]
[4421] “Then there is Mrs. Cavendish,” continued Poirot. “That’s another who[4422] is not telling all she knows! What do you make of her attitude?”[4423] [13]
[4424] “I don’t know what to make of it. It seems inconceivable that she[4425] should be shielding Alfred Inglethorp. Yet that is what it looks like.”[4426] [13]
[4427] Poirot nodded reflectively.[4428] [13]
[4429] “Yes, it is queer. One thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more[4430] of that ‘private conversation’ than she was willing to admit.”[4431] [13]
[4432] “And yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to[4433] eavesdrop!”[4434] [13]
[4435] “Exactly. One thing her evidence _has_ shown me. I made a mistake.[4436] Dorcas was quite right. The quarrel did take place earlier in the[4437] afternoon, about four o’clock, as she said.”[4438] [13]
[4439] I looked at him curiously. I had never understood his insistence on[4440] that point.[4441] [13]
[4442] “Yes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day,” continued Poirot.[4443] “Dr. Bauerstein, now, what was _he_ doing up and dressed at that hour[4444] in the morning? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the[4445] fact.”[4446] [13]
[4447] “He has insomnia, I believe,” I said doubtfully.[4448] [13]
[4449] “Which is a very good, or a very bad explanation,” remarked Poirot. “It[4450] covers everything, and explains nothing. I shall keep my eye on our[4451] clever Dr. Bauerstein.”[4452] [13]
[4453] “Any more faults to find with the evidence?” I inquired satirically.[4454] [13]
[4455] “_Mon ami_,” replied Poirot gravely, “when you find that people are not[4456] telling you the truth—look out! Now, unless I am much mistaken, at the[4457] inquest to-day only one—at most, two persons were speaking the truth[4458] without reservation or subterfuge.”[4459] [13]
[4460] “Oh, come now, Poirot! I won’t cite Lawrence, or Mrs. Cavendish. But[4461] there’s John—and Miss Howard, surely they were speaking the truth?”[4462] [13]
[4463] “Both of them, my friend? One, I grant you, but both——!”[4464] [13]
[4465] His words gave me an unpleasant shock. Miss Howard’s evidence,[4466] unimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright[4467] straightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her[4468] sincerity. Still, I had a great respect for Poirot’s sagacity—except on[4469] the occasions when he was what I described to myself as “foolishly[4470] pig-headed.”[4471] [13]
[4472] “Do you really think so?” I asked. “Miss Howard had always seemed to me[4473] so essentially honest—almost uncomfortably so.”[4474] [13]
[4475] Poirot gave me a curious look, which I could not quite fathom. He[4476] seemed to speak, and then checked himself.[4477] [13]
[4478] “Miss Murdoch too,” I continued, “there’s nothing untruthful about[4479] _her_.”[4480] [13]
[4481] “No. But it was strange that she never heard a sound, sleeping next[4482] door; whereas Mrs. Cavendish, in the other wing of the building,[4483] distinctly heard the table fall.”[4484] [13]
[4485] “Well, she’s young. And she sleeps soundly.”[4486] [13]
[4487] “Ah, yes, indeed! She must be a famous sleeper, that one!”[4488] [13]
[4489] I did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart[4490] knock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the[4491] two detectives waiting for us below.[4492] [13]
[4493] Poirot seized his hat, gave a ferocious twist to his moustache, and,[4494] carefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned[4495] me to precede him down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and[4496] set out for Styles.[4497] [13]
[4498] I think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a[4499] shock—especially to John, though of course after the verdict, he had[4500] realized that it was only a matter of time. Still, the presence of the[4501] detectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could[4502] have done.[4503] [13]
[4504] Poirot had conferred with Japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was[4505] the latter functionary who requested that the household, with the[4506] exception of the servants, should be assembled together in the[4507] drawing-room. I realized the significance of this. It was up to Poirot[4508] to make his boast good.[4509] [13]
[4510] Personally, I was not sanguine. Poirot might have excellent reasons for[4511] his belief in Inglethorp’s innocence, but a man of the type of[4512] Summerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these I doubted if Poirot[4513] could supply.[4514] [13]
[4515] Before very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door of[4516] which Japp closed. Poirot politely set chairs for everyone. The[4517] Scotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. I think that for the[4518] first time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a[4519] tangible reality. We had read of such things—now we ourselves were[4520] actors in the drama. To-morrow the daily papers, all over England,[4521] would blazon out the news in staring headlines:[4522] [13]
[4523] “MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEX”[4524] [13]
[4525]     “WEALTHY LADY POISONED”[4526] [13]
[4527] [13]
[4528] There would be pictures of Styles, snap-shots of “The family leaving[4529] the Inquest”—the village photographer had not been idle! All the things[4530] that one had read a hundred times—things that happen to other people,[4531] not to oneself. And now, in this house, a murder had been committed. In[4532] front of us were “the detectives in charge of the case.” The well-known[4533] glib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before[4534] Poirot opened the proceedings.[4535] [13]
[4536] I think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not[4537] one of the official detectives who took the initiative.[4538] [13]
[4539] “_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_,” said Poirot, bowing as though he were a[4540] celebrity about to deliver a lecture, “I have asked you to come here[4541] all together, for a certain object. That object, it concerns Mr. Alfred[4542] Inglethorp.”[4543] [13]
[4544] Inglethorp was sitting a little by himself—I think, unconsciously,[4545] everyone had drawn his chair slightly away from him—and he gave a faint[4546] start as Poirot pronounced his name.[4547] [13]
[4548] “Mr. Inglethorp,” said Poirot, addressing him directly, “a very dark[4549] shadow is resting on this house—the shadow of murder.”[4550] [13]
[4551] Inglethorp shook his head sadly.[4552] [13]
[4553] “My poor wife,” he murmured. “Poor Emily! It is terrible.”[4554] [13]
[4555] “I do not think, monsieur,” said Poirot pointedly, “that you quite[4556] realize how terrible it may be—for you.” And as Inglethorp did not[4557] appear to understand, he added: “Mr. Inglethorp, you are standing in[4558] very grave danger.”[4559] [13]
[4560] The two detectives fidgeted. I saw the official caution “Anything you[4561] say will be used in evidence against you,” actually hovering on[4562] Summerhaye’s lips. Poirot went on.[4563] [13]
[4564] “Do you understand now, monsieur?”[4565] [13]
[4566] “No. What do you mean?”[4567] [13]
[4568] “I mean,” said Poirot deliberately, “that you are suspected of[4569] poisoning your wife.”[4570] [13]
[4571] A little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking.[4572] [13]
[4573] “Good heavens!” cried Inglethorp, starting up. “What a monstrous idea![4574] _I_—poison my dearest Emily!”[4575] [13]
[4576] “I do not think”—Poirot watched him narrowly—“that you quite realize[4577] the unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest. Mr.[4578] Inglethorp, knowing what I have now told you, do you still refuse to[4579] say where you were at six o’clock on Monday afternoon?”[4580] [13]
[4581] With a groan, Alfred Inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in[4582] his hands. Poirot approached and stood over him.[4583] [13]
[4584] “Speak!” he cried menacingly.[4585] [13]
[4586] With an effort, Inglethorp raised his face from his hands. Then, slowly[4587] and deliberately, he shook his head.[4588] [13]
[4589] “You will not speak?”[4590] [13]
[4591] “No. I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me[4592] of what you say.”[4593] [13]
[4594] Poirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up.[4595] [13]
[4596] “_Soit!_” he said. “Then I must speak for you.”[4597] [13]
[4598] Alfred Inglethorp sprang up again.[4599] [13]
[4600] “You? How can you speak? You do not know——” he broke off abruptly.[4601] [13]
[4602] Poirot turned to face us. “_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_! I speak! Listen![4603] I, Hercule Poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist’s shop,[4604] and purchased strychnine at six o’clock on Monday last was not Mr.[4605] Inglethorp, for at six o’clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting[4606] Mrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm. I can produce no[4607] less than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either[4608] at six or just after and, as you may know, the Abbey Farm, Mrs.[4609] Raikes’s home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the[4610] village. There is absolutely no question as to the alibi!”[4611] [13]
[4612] [13]
[4613] [13]
[4614] [13]
[4615] CHAPTER VIII.[4616] FRESH SUSPICIONS[4617] [13]
[4618] [13]
[4619] There was a moment’s stupefied silence. Japp, who was the least[4620] surprised of any of us, was the first to speak.[4621] [13]
[4622] “My word,” he cried, “you’re the goods! And no mistake, Mr. Poirot![4623] These witnesses of yours are all right, I suppose?”[4624] [13]
[4625] “_Voilà!_ I have prepared a list of them—names and addresses. You must[4626] see them, of course. But you will find it all right.”[4627] [13]
[4628] “I’m sure of that.” Japp lowered his voice. “I’m much obliged to you. A[4629] pretty mare’s nest arresting him would have been.” He turned to[4630] Inglethorp. “But, if you’ll excuse me, sir, why couldn’t you say all[4631] this at the inquest?”[4632] [13]
[4633] “I will tell you why,” interrupted Poirot. “There was a certain[4634] rumour——”[4635] [13]
[4636] “A most malicious and utterly untrue one,” interrupted Alfred[4637] Inglethorp in an agitated voice.[4638] [13]
[4639] “And Mr. Inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at[4640] present. Am I right?”[4641] [13]
[4642] “Quite right.” Inglethorp nodded. “With my poor Emily not yet buried,[4643] can you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be[4644] started.”[4645] [13]
[4646] “Between you and me, sir,” remarked Japp, “I’d sooner have any amount[4647] of rumours than be arrested for murder. And I venture to think your[4648] poor lady would have felt the same. And, if it hadn’t been for Mr.[4649] Poirot here, arrested you would have been, as sure as eggs is eggs!”[4650] [13]
[4651] “I was foolish, no doubt,” murmured Inglethorp. “But you do not know,[4652] inspector, how I have been persecuted and maligned.” And he shot a[4653] baleful glance at Evelyn Howard.[4654] [13]
[4655] “Now, sir,” said Japp, turning briskly to John, “I should like to see[4656] the lady’s bedroom, please, and after that I’ll have a little chat with[4657] the servants. Don’t you bother about anything. Mr. Poirot, here, will[4658] show me the way.”[4659] [13]
[4660] As they all went out of the room, Poirot turned and made me a sign to[4661] follow him upstairs. There he caught me by the arm, and drew me aside.[4662] [13]
[4663] “Quick, go to the other wing. Stand there—just this side of the baize[4664] door. Do not move till I come.” Then, turning rapidly, he rejoined the[4665] two detectives.[4666] [13]
[4667] I followed his instructions, taking up my position by the baize door,[4668] and wondering what on earth lay behind the request. Why was I to stand[4669] in this particular spot on guard? I looked thoughtfully down the[4670] corridor in front of me. An idea struck me. With the exception of[4671] Cynthia Murdoch’s, everyone’s room was in this left wing. Had that[4672] anything to do with it? Was I to report who came or went? I stood[4673] faithfully at my post. The minutes passed. Nobody came. Nothing[4674] happened.[4675] [13]
[4676] It must have been quite twenty minutes before Poirot rejoined me.[4677] [13]
[4678] “You have not stirred?”[4679] [13]
[4680] “No, I’ve stuck here like a rock. Nothing’s happened.”[4681] [13]
[4682] “Ah!” Was he pleased, or disappointed? “You’ve seen nothing at all?”[4683] [13]
[4684] “No.”[4685] [13]
[4686] “But you have probably heard something? A big bump—eh, _mon ami?_”[4687] [13]
[4688] “No.”[4689] [13]
[4690] “Is it possible? Ah, but I am vexed with myself! I am not usually[4691] clumsy. I made but a slight gesture”—I know Poirot’s gestures—“with the[4692] left hand, and over went the table by the bed!”[4693] [13]
[4694] He looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that I hastened to[4695] console him.[4696] [13]
[4697] “Never mind, old chap. What does it matter? Your triumph downstairs[4698] excited you. I can tell you, that was a surprise to us all. There must[4699] be more in this affair of Inglethorp’s with Mrs. Raikes than we[4700] thought, to make him hold his tongue so persistently. What are you[4701] going to do now? Where are the Scotland Yard fellows?”[4702] [13]
[4703] “Gone down to interview the servants. I showed them all our exhibits. I[4704] am disappointed in Japp. He has no method!”[4705] [13]
[4706] “Hullo!” I said, looking out of the window. “Here’s Dr. Bauerstein. I[4707] believe you’re right about that man, Poirot. I don’t like him.”[4708] [13]
[4709] “He is clever,” observed Poirot meditatively.[4710] [13]
[4711] “Oh, clever as the devil! I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the[4712] plight he was in on Tuesday. You never saw such a spectacle!” And I[4713] described the doctor’s adventure. “He looked a regular scarecrow![4714] Plastered with mud from head to foot.”[4715] [13]
[4716] “You saw him, then?”[4717] [13]
[4718] “Yes. Of course, he didn’t want to come in—it was just after dinner—but[4719] Mr. Inglethorp insisted.”[4720] [13]
[4721] “What?” Poirot caught me violently by the shoulders. “Was Dr.[4722] Bauerstein here on Tuesday evening? Here? And you never told me? Why[4723] did you not tell me? Why? Why?”[4724] [13]
[4725] He appeared to be in an absolute frenzy.[4726] [13]
[4727] “My dear Poirot,” I expostulated, “I never thought it would interest[4728] you. I didn’t know it was of any importance.”[4729] [13]
[4730] “Importance? It is of the first importance! So Dr. Bauerstein was here[4731] on Tuesday night—the night of the murder. Hastings, do you not see?[4732] That alters everything—everything!”[4733] [13]
[4734] I had never seen him so upset. Loosening his hold of me, he[4735] mechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to[4736] himself: “Yes, that alters everything—everything.”[4737] [13]
[4738] Suddenly he seemed to come to a decision.[4739] [13]
[4740] “_Allons!_” he said. “We must act at once. Where is Mr. Cavendish?”[4741] [13]
[4742] John was in the smoking-room. Poirot went straight to him.[4743] [13]
[4744] “Mr. Cavendish, I have some important business in Tadminster. A new[4745] clue. May I take your motor?”[4746] [13]
[4747] “Why, of course. Do you mean at once?”[4748] [13]
[4749] “If you please.”[4750] [13]
[4751] John rang the bell, and ordered round the car. In another ten minutes,[4752] we were racing down the park and along the high road to Tadminster.[4753] [13]
[4754] “Now, Poirot,” I remarked resignedly, “perhaps you will tell me what[4755] all this is about?”[4756] [13]
[4757] “Well, _mon ami_, a good deal you can guess for yourself. Of course you[4758] realize that, now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is[4759] greatly changed. We are face to face with an entirely new problem. We[4760] know now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. We have[4761] cleared away the manufactured clues. Now for the real ones. I have[4762] ascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs.[4763] Cavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr.[4764] Inglethorp on Monday evening. In the same way, we have his statement[4765] that he put the coffee down in the hall. No one took much notice of[4766] that at the inquest—but now it has a very different significance. We[4767] must find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually,[4768] or who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there. From your[4769] account, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not[4770] go near the coffee—Mrs. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.”[4771] [13]
[4772] “Yes, that is so.” I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart.[4773] Mary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion.[4774] [13]
[4775] “In clearing Alfred Inglethorp,” continued Poirot, “I have been obliged[4776] to show my hand sooner than I intended. As long as I might be thought[4777] to be pursuing him, the criminal would be off his guard. Now, he will[4778] be doubly careful. Yes—doubly careful.” He turned to me abruptly. “Tell[4779] me, Hastings, you yourself—have you no suspicions of anybody?”[4780] [13]
[4781] I hesitated. To tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in[4782] itself, had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain. I had[4783] rejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted.[4784] [13]
[4785] “You couldn’t call it a suspicion,” I murmured. “It’s so utterly[4786] foolish.”[4787] [13]
[4788] “Come now,” urged Poirot encouragingly. “Do not fear. Speak your mind.[4789] You should always pay attention to your instincts.”[4790] [13]
[4791] “Well then,” I blurted out, “it’s absurd—but I suspect Miss Howard of[4792] not telling all she knows!”[4793] [13]
[4794] “Miss Howard?”[4795] [13]
[4796] “Yes—you’ll laugh at me——”[4797] [13]
[4798] “Not at all. Why should I?”[4799] [13]
[4800] “I can’t help feeling,” I continued blunderingly; “that we’ve rather[4801] left her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her[4802] having been away from the place. But, after all, she was only fifteen[4803] miles away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively[4804] that she was away from Styles on the night of the murder?”[4805] [13]
[4806] “Yes, my friend,” said Poirot unexpectedly, “we can. One of my first[4807] actions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.”[4808] [13]
[4809] “Well?”[4810] [13]
[4811] “Well, I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday,[4812] and that—a convoy coming in unexpectedly—she had kindly offered to[4813] remain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. That[4814] disposes of that.”[4815] [13]
[4816] “Oh!” I said, rather nonplussed. “Really,” I continued, “it’s her[4817] extraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off[4818] suspecting her. I can’t help feeling she’d do anything against him. And[4819] I had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the[4820] will. She might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier[4821] one in his favour. She is so terribly bitter against him.”[4822] [13]
[4823] “You consider her vehemence unnatural?”[4824] [13]
[4825] “Y—es. She is so very violent. I wondered really whether she is quite[4826] sane on that point.”[4827] [13]
[4828] Poirot shook his head energetically.[4829] [13]
[4830] “No, no, you are on a wrong tack there. There is nothing weak-minded or[4831] degenerate about Miss Howard. She is an excellent specimen of[4832] well-balanced English beef and brawn. She is sanity itself.”[4833] [13]
[4834] “Yet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania. My idea was—a very[4835] ridiculous one, no doubt—that she had intended to poison him—and that,[4836] in some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake. But I don’t at[4837] all see how it could have been done. The whole thing is absurd and[4838] ridiculous to the last degree.”[4839] [13]
[4840] “Still you are right in one thing. It is always wise to suspect[4841] everybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction,[4842] that they are innocent. Now, what reasons are there against Miss[4843] Howard’s having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp?”[4844] [13]
[4845] “Why, she was devoted to her!” I exclaimed.[4846] [13]
[4847] “Tcha! Tcha!” cried Poirot irritably. “You argue like a child. If Miss[4848] Howard were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite[4849] equally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You[4850] are perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against[4851] Alfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong[4852] in the deduction you draw from it. I have drawn my own deductions,[4853] which I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at[4854] present.” He paused a minute, then went on. “Now, to my way of[4855] thinking, there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard’s being the[4856] murderess.”[4857] [13]
[4858] “And that is?”[4859] [13]
[4860] “That in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp’s death benefit Miss[4861] Howard. Now there is no murder without a motive.”[4862] [13]
[4863] I reflected.[4864] [13]
[4865] “Could not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour?”[4866] [13]
[4867] Poirot shook his head.[4868] [13]
[4869] “But you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells?”[4870] [13]
[4871] Poirot smiled.[4872] [13]
[4873] “That was for a reason. I did not want to mention the name of the[4874] person who was actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupied very much the[4875] same position, so I used her name instead.”[4876] [13]
[4877] “Still, Mrs. Inglethorp might have done so. Why, that will, made on the[4878] afternoon of her death may——”[4879] [13]
[4880] But Poirot’s shake of the head was so energetic that I stopped.[4881] [13]
[4882] “No, my friend. I have certain little ideas of my own about that will.[4883] But I can tell you this much—it was not in Miss Howard’s favour.”[4884] [13]
[4885] I accepted his assurance, though I did not really see how he could be[4886] so positive about the matter.[4887] [13]
[4888] “Well,” I said, with a sigh, “we will acquit Miss Howard, then. It is[4889] partly your fault that I ever came to suspect her. It was what you said[4890] about her evidence at the inquest that set me off.”[4891] [13]
[4892] Poirot looked puzzled.[4893] [13]
[4894] “What did I say about her evidence at the inquest?”[4895] [13]
[4896] “Don’t you remember? When I cited her and John Cavendish as being above[4897] suspicion?”[4898] [13]
[4899] “Oh—ah—yes.” He seemed a little confused, but recovered himself. “By[4900] the way, Hastings, there is something I want you to do for me.”[4901] [13]
[4902] “Certainly. What is it?”[4903] [13]
[4904] “Next time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you[4905] to say this to him. ‘I have a message for you, from Poirot. He says:[4906] “Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!”’ Nothing more.[4907] Nothing less.”[4908] [13]
[4909] “‘Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’ Is that[4910] right?” I asked, much mystified.[4911] [13]
[4912] “Excellent.”[4913] [13]
[4914] “But what does it mean?”[4915] [13]
[4916] “Ah, that I will leave you to find out. You have access to the facts.[4917] Just say that to him, and see what he says.”[4918] [13]
[4919] “Very well—but it’s all extremely mysterious.”[4920] [13]
[4921] We were running into Tadminster now, and Poirot directed the car to the[4922] “Analytical Chemist.”[4923] [13]
[4924] Poirot hopped down briskly, and went inside. In a few minutes he was[4925] back again.[4926] [13]
[4927] “There,” he said. “That is all my business.”[4928] [13]
[4929] “What were you doing there?” I asked, in lively curiosity.[4930] [13]
[4931] “I left something to be analysed.”[4932] [13]
[4933] “Yes, but what?”[4934] [13]
[4935] “The sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom.”[4936] [13]
[4937] “But that has already been tested!” I cried, stupefied. “Dr. Bauerstein[4938] had it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there[4939] being strychnine in it.”[4940] [13]
[4941] “I know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested,” replied Poirot quietly.[4942] [13]
[4943] “Well, then?”[4944] [13]
[4945] “Well, I have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.”[4946] [13]
[4947] And not another word on the subject could I drag out of him.[4948] [13]
[4949] This proceeding of Poirot’s, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me[4950] intensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my[4951] confidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully[4952] restored since his belief in Alfred Inglethorp’s innocence had been so[4953] triumphantly vindicated.[4954] [13]
[4955] The funeral of Mrs. Inglethorp took place the following day, and on[4956] Monday, as I came down to a late breakfast, John drew me aside, and[4957] informed me that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up[4958] his quarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his[4959] plans.[4960] [13]
[4961] “And really it’s a great relief to think he’s going, Hastings,”[4962] continued my honest friend. “It was bad enough before, when we thought[4963] he’d done it, but I’m hanged if it isn’t worse now, when we all feel[4964] guilty for having been so down on the fellow. The fact is, we’ve[4965] treated him abominably. Of course, things did look black against him. I[4966] don’t see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we[4967] did. Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there’s a[4968] beastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when[4969] one doesn’t like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole[4970] thing’s damned awkward! And I’m thankful he’s had the tact to take[4971] himself off. It’s a good thing Styles wasn’t the mater’s to leave to[4972] him. Couldn’t bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He’s welcome[4973] to her money.”[4974] [13]
[4975] “You’ll be able to keep up the place all right?” I asked.[4976] [13]
[4977] “Oh, yes. There are the death duties, of course, but half my father’s[4978] money goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the[4979] present, so there is his share as well. We shall be pinched at first,[4980] of course, because, as I once told you, I am in a bit of a hole[4981] financially myself. Still, the Johnnies will wait now.”[4982] [13]
[4983] In the general relief at Inglethorp’s approaching departure, we had the[4984] most genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. Cynthia,[4985] whose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her[4986] pretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who[4987] seemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the[4988] opening of a new and hopeful future.[4989] [13]
[4990] The papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. Glaring headlines,[4991] sandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle[4992] innuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue.[4993] Nothing was spared us. It was a slack time. The war was momentarily[4994] inactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in[4995] fashionable life: “The Mysterious Affair at Styles” was the topic of[4996] the moment.[4997] [13]
[4998] Naturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes. The house was[4999] constantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied[5000] admission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds,[5001] where they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the[5002] household. We all lived in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men[5003] came and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of[5004] tongue. Towards what end they were working, we did not know. Had they[5005] any clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of[5006] undiscovered crimes?[5007] [13]
[5008] After breakfast, Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if[5009] she might have a few words with me.[5010] [13]
[5011] “Certainly. What is it, Dorcas?”[5012] [13]
[5013] “Well, it’s just this, sir. You’ll be seeing the Belgian gentleman[5014] to-day perhaps?” I nodded. “Well, sir, you know how he asked me so[5015] particular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?”[5016] [13]
[5017] “Yes, yes. You have found one?” My interest was aroused.[5018] [13]
[5019] “No, not that, sir. But since then I’ve remembered what the young[5020] gentlemen”—John and Lawrence were still the “young gentlemen” to[5021] Dorcas—“call the ‘dressing-up box.’ It’s up in the front attic, sir. A[5022] great chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. And[5023] it came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst[5024] them. So, if you’d tell the Belgian gentleman——”[5025] [13]
[5026] “I will tell him, Dorcas,” I promised.[5027] [13]
[5028] “Thank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he is, sir. And quite[5029] a different class from them two detectives from London, what goes[5030] prying about, and asking questions. I don’t hold with foreigners as a[5031] rule, but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave[5032] Belges isn’t the ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly he’s a most[5033] polite spoken gentleman.”[5034] [13]
[5035] Dear old Dorcas! As she stood there, with her honest face upturned to[5036] mine, I thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned[5037] servant that is so fast dying out.[5038] [13]
[5039] I thought I might as well go down to the village at once, and look up[5040] Poirot; but I met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at once[5041] gave him Dorcas’s message.[5042] [13]
[5043] “Ah, the brave Dorcas! We will look at the chest, although—but no[5044] matter—we will examine it all the same.”[5045] [13]
[5046] We entered the house by one of the windows. There was no one in the[5047] hall, and we went straight up to the attic.[5048] [13]
[5049] Sure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with[5050] brass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of[5051] garment.[5052] [13]
[5053] Poirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. There[5054] were one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but Poirot shook his[5055] head over them all. He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as[5056] though he expected no great results from it. Suddenly he gave an[5057] exclamation.[5058] [13]
[5059] “What is it?”[5060] [13]
[5061] “Look!”[5062] [13]
[5063] The chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom,[5064] was a magnificent black beard.[5065] [13]
[5066] “_Ohó!_” said Poirot. “_Ohó!_” He turned it over in his hands,[5067] examining it closely. “New,” he remarked. “Yes, quite new.”[5068] [13]
[5069] After a moment’s hesitation, he replaced it in the chest, heaped all[5070] the other things on top of it as before, and made his way briskly[5071] downstairs. He went straight to the pantry, where we found Dorcas[5072] busily polishing her silver.[5073] [13]
[5074] Poirot wished her good morning with Gallic politeness, and went on:[5075] [13]
[5076] “We have been looking through that chest, Dorcas. I am much obliged to[5077] you for mentioning it. There is, indeed, a fine collection there. Are[5078] they often used, may I ask?”[5079] [13]
[5080] “Well, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do[5081] have what the young gentlemen call ‘a dress-up night.’ And very funny[5082] it is sometimes, sir. Mr. Lawrence, he’s wonderful. Most comic! I shall[5083] never forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia, I think he[5084] called it—a sort of Eastern King it was. He had the big paper knife in[5085] his hand, and ‘Mind, Dorcas,’ he says, ‘you’ll have to be very[5086] respectful. This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it’s off with[5087] your head if I’m at all displeased with you!’ Miss Cynthia, she was[5088] what they call an Apache, or some such name—a Frenchified sort of[5089] cut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she looked. You’d never have[5090] believed a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into[5091] such a ruffian. Nobody would have known her.”[5092] [13]
[5093] “These evenings must have been great fun,” said Poirot genially. “I[5094] suppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs,[5095] when he was Shah of Persia?”[5096] [13]
[5097] “He did have a beard, sir,” replied Dorcas, smiling. “And well I know[5098] it, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! And[5099] I’m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn’t know as[5100] there was a beard up there at all. It must have been got quite lately,[5101] I think. There was a red wig, I know, but nothing else in the way of[5102] hair. Burnt corks they use mostly—though ‘tis messy getting it off[5103] again. Miss Cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she had.”[5104] [13]
[5105] “So Dorcas knows nothing about that black beard,” said Poirot[5106] thoughtfully, as we walked out into the hall again.[5107] [13]
[5108] “Do you think it is _the_ one?” I whispered eagerly.[5109] [13]
[5110] Poirot nodded.[5111] [13]
[5112] “I do. You notice it had been trimmed?”[5113] [13]
[5114] “No.”[5115] [13]
[5116] “Yes. It was cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp’s, and I found one[5117] or two snipped hairs. Hastings, this affair is very deep.”[5118] [13]
[5119] “Who put it in the chest, I wonder?”[5120] [13]
[5121] “Someone with a good deal of intelligence,” remarked Poirot dryly. “You[5122] realize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its[5123] presence would not be remarked? Yes, he is intelligent. But we must be[5124] more intelligent. We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us[5125] of being intelligent at all.”[5126] [13]
[5127] I acquiesced.[5128] [13]
[5129] “There, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me.”[5130] [13]
[5131] I was pleased with the compliment. There had been times when I hardly[5132] thought that Poirot appreciated me at my true worth.[5133] [13]
[5134] “Yes,” he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, “you will be[5135] invaluable.”[5136] [13]
[5137] This was naturally gratifying, but Poirot’s next words were not so[5138] welcome.[5139] [13]
[5140] “I must have an ally in the house,” he observed reflectively.[5141] [13]
[5142] “You have me,” I protested.[5143] [13]
[5144] “True, but you are not sufficient.”[5145] [13]
[5146] I was hurt, and showed it. Poirot hurried to explain himself.[5147] [13]
[5148] “You do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me.[5149] I want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.”[5150] [13]
[5151] “Oh, I see. How about John?”[5152] [13]
[5153] “No, I think not.”[5154] [13]
[5155] “The dear fellow isn’t perhaps very bright,” I said thoughtfully.[5156] [13]
[5157] “Here comes Miss Howard,” said Poirot suddenly. “She is the very[5158] person. But I am in her black books, since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp.[5159] Still, we can but try.”[5160] [13]
[5161] With a nod that was barely civil, Miss Howard assented to Poirot’s[5162] request for a few minutes’ conversation.[5163] [13]
[5164] We went into the little morning-room, and Poirot closed the door.[5165] [13]
[5166] “Well, Monsieur Poirot,” said Miss Howard impatiently, “what is it? Out[5167] with it. I’m busy.”[5168] [13]
[5169] “Do you remember, mademoiselle, that I once asked you to help me?”[5170] [13]
[5171] “Yes, I do.” The lady nodded. “And I told you I’d help you with[5172] pleasure—to hang Alfred Inglethorp.”[5173] [13]
[5174] “Ah!” Poirot studied her seriously. “Miss Howard, I will ask you one[5175] question. I beg of you to reply to it truthfully.”[5176] [13]
[5177] “Never tell lies,” replied Miss Howard.[5178] [13]
[5179] “It is this. Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by[5180] her husband?”[5181] [13]
[5182] “What do you mean?” she asked sharply. “You needn’t think your pretty[5183] explanations influence me in the slightest. I’ll admit that it wasn’t[5184] he who bought strychnine at the chemist’s shop. What of that? I dare[5185] say he soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.”[5186] [13]
[5187] “That is arsenic—not strychnine,” said Poirot mildly.[5188] [13]
[5189] “What does that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way[5190] just as well as strychnine. If I’m convinced he did it, it doesn’t[5191] matter a jot to me _how_ he did it.”[5192] [13]
[5193] “Exactly. _If_ you are convinced he did it,” said Poirot quietly. “I[5194] will put my question in another form. Did you ever in your heart of[5195] hearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?”[5196] [13]
[5197] “Good heavens!” cried Miss Howard. “Haven’t I always told you the man[5198] is a villain? Haven’t I always told you he would murder her in her bed?[5199] Haven’t I always hated him like poison?”[5200] [13]
[5201] “Exactly,” said Poirot. “That bears out my little idea entirely.”[5202] [13]
[5203] “What little idea?”[5204] [13]
[5205] “Miss Howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day[5206] of my friend’s arrival here? He repeated it to me, and there is a[5207] sentence of yours that has impressed me very much. Do you remember[5208] affirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had[5209] been murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the[5210] criminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?”[5211] [13]
[5212] “Yes, I remember saying that. I believe it too. I suppose you think it[5213] nonsense?”[5214] [13]
[5215] “Not at all.”[5216] [13]
[5217] “And yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against Alfred[5218] Inglethorp.”[5219] [13]
[5220] “No,” said Poirot curtly. “Because your instinct is not against Mr.[5221] Inglethorp.”[5222] [13]
[5223] “What?”[5224] [13]
[5225] “No. You wish to believe he committed the crime. You believe him[5226] capable of committing it. But your instinct tells you he did not commit[5227] it. It tells you more—shall I go on?”[5228] [13]
[5229] She was staring at him, fascinated, and made a slight affirmative[5230] movement of the hand.[5231] [13]
[5232] “Shall I tell you why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp?[5233] It is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe.[5234] It is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which[5235] tells you another name——”[5236] [13]
[5237] “No, no, no!” cried Miss Howard wildly, flinging up her hands. “Don’t[5238] say it! Oh, don’t say it! It isn’t true! It can’t be true. I don’t know[5239] what put such a wild—such a dreadful—idea into my head!”[5240] [13]
[5241] “I am right, am I not?” asked Poirot.[5242] [13]
[5243] “Yes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. But it can’t be[5244] so—it’s too monstrous, too impossible. It _must_ be Alfred Inglethorp.”[5245] [13]
[5246] Poirot shook his head gravely.[5247] [13]
[5248] “Don’t ask me about it,” continued Miss Howard, “because I shan’t tell[5249] you. I won’t admit it, even to myself. I must be mad to think of such a[5250] thing.”[5251] [13]
[5252] Poirot nodded, as if satisfied.[5253] [13]
[5254] “I will ask you nothing. It is enough for me that it is as I thought.[5255] And I—I, too, have an instinct. We are working together towards a[5256] common end.”[5257] [13]
[5258] “Don’t ask me to help you, because I won’t. I wouldn’t lift a finger[5259] to—to——” She faltered.[5260] [13]
[5261] “You will help me in spite of yourself. I ask you nothing—but you will[5262] be my ally. You will not be able to help yourself. You will do the only[5263] thing that I want of you.”[5264] [13]
[5265] “And that is?”[5266] [13]
[5267] “You will watch!”[5268] [13]
[5269] Evelyn Howard bowed her head.[5270] [13]
[5271] “Yes, I can’t help doing that. I am always watching—always hoping I[5272] shall be proved wrong.”[5273] [13]
[5274] “If we are wrong, well and good,” said Poirot. “No one will be more[5275] pleased than I shall. But, if we are right? If we are right, Miss[5276] Howard, on whose side are you then?”[5277] [13]
[5278] “I don’t know, I don’t know——”[5279] [13]
[5280] “Come now.”[5281] [13]
[5282] “It could be hushed up.”[5283] [13]
[5284] “There must be no hushing up.”[5285] [13]
[5286] “But Emily herself——” She broke off.[5287] [13]
[5288] “Miss Howard,” said Poirot gravely, “this is unworthy of you.”[5289] [13]
[5290] Suddenly she took her face from her hands.[5291] [13]
[5292] “Yes,” she said quietly, “that was not Evelyn Howard who spoke!” She[5293] flung her head up proudly. “_This_ is Evelyn Howard! And she is on the[5294] side of Justice! Let the cost be what it may.” And with these words,[5295] she walked firmly out of the room.[5296] [13]
[5297] “There,” said Poirot, looking after her, “goes a very valuable ally.[5298] That woman, Hastings, has got brains as well as a heart.”[5299] [13]
[5300] I did not reply.[5301] [13]
[5302] “Instinct is a marvellous thing,” mused Poirot. “It can neither be[5303] explained nor ignored.”[5304] [13]
[5305] “You and Miss Howard seem to know what you are talking about,” I[5306] observed coldly. “Perhaps you don’t realize that _I_ am still in the[5307] dark.”[5308] [13]
[5309] “Really? Is that so, _mon ami?_”[5310] [13]
[5311] “Yes. Enlighten me, will you?”[5312] [13]
[5313] Poirot studied me attentively for a moment or two. Then, to my intense[5314] surprise, he shook his head decidedly.[5315] [13]
[5316] “No, my friend.”[5317] [13]
[5318] “Oh, look here, why not?”[5319] [13]
[5320] “Two is enough for a secret.”[5321] [13]
[5322] “Well, I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me.”[5323] [13]
[5324] “I am not keeping back facts. Every fact that I know is in your[5325] possession. You can draw your own deductions from them. This time it is[5326] a question of ideas.”[5327] [13]
[5328] “Still, it would be interesting to know.”[5329] [13]
[5330] Poirot looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his head.[5331] [13]
[5332] “You see,” he said sadly, “_you_ have no instincts.”[5333] [13]
[5334] “It was intelligence you were requiring just now,” I pointed out.[5335] [13]
[5336] “The two often go together,” said Poirot enigmatically.[5337] [13]
[5338] The remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that I did not even take the[5339] trouble to answer it. But I decided that if I made any interesting and[5340] important discoveries—as no doubt I should—I would keep them to myself,[5341] and surprise Poirot with the ultimate result.[5342] [13]
[5343] There are times when it is one’s duty to assert oneself.[5344] [13]
[5345] [13]
[5346] [13]
[5347] [13]
[5348] CHAPTER IX.[5349] DR. BAUERSTEIN[5350] [13]
[5351] [13]
[5352] I had had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirot’s message to[5353] Lawrence. But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a[5354] grudge against my friend’s high-handedness, I saw Lawrence on the[5355] croquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about,[5356] with a still more ancient mallet.[5357] [13]
[5358] It struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message.[5359] Otherwise, Poirot himself might relieve me of it. It was true that I[5360] did not quite gather its purport, but I flattered myself that by[5361] Lawrence’s reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my[5362] part, I should soon perceive its significance. Accordingly I accosted[5363] him.[5364] [13]
[5365] “I’ve been looking for you,” I remarked untruthfully.[5366] [13]
[5367] “Have you?”[5368] [13]
[5369] “Yes. The truth is, I’ve got a message for you—from Poirot.”[5370] [13]
[5371] “Yes?”[5372] [13]
[5373] “He told me to wait until I was alone with you,” I said, dropping my[5374] voice significantly, and watching him intently out of the corner of my[5375] eye. I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe,[5376] creating an atmosphere.[5377] [13]
[5378] “Well?”[5379] [13]
[5380] There was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face. Had he[5381] any idea of what I was about to say?[5382] [13]
[5383] “This is the message.” I dropped my voice still lower. “‘Find the extra[5384] coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’”[5385] [13]
[5386] “What on earth does he mean?” Lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected[5387] astonishment.[5388] [13]
[5389] “Don’t you know?”[5390] [13]
[5391] “Not in the least. Do you?”[5392] [13]
[5393] I was compelled to shake my head.[5394] [13]
[5395] “What extra coffee-cup?”[5396] [13]
[5397] “I don’t know.”[5398] [13]
[5399] “He’d better ask Dorcas, or one of the maids, if he wants to know about[5400] coffee-cups. It’s their business, not mine. I don’t know anything about[5401] the coffee-cups, except that we’ve got some that are never used, which[5402] are a perfect dream! Old Worcester. You’re not a connoisseur, are you,[5403] Hastings?”[5404] [13]
[5405] I shook my head.[5406] [13]
[5407] “You miss a lot. A really perfect bit of old china—it’s pure delight to[5408] handle it, or even to look at it.”[5409] [13]
[5410] “Well, what am I to tell Poirot?”[5411] [13]
[5412] “Tell him I don’t know what he’s talking about. It’s double Dutch to[5413] me.”[5414] [13]
[5415] “All right.”[5416] [13]
[5417] I was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me[5418] back.[5419] [13]
[5420] “I say, what was the end of that message? Say it over again, will you?”[5421] [13]
[5422] “‘Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’ Are you sure[5423] you don’t know what it means?” I asked him earnestly.[5424] [13]
[5425] He shook his head.[5426] [13]
[5427] “No,” he said musingly, “I don’t. I—I wish I did.”[5428] [13]
[5429] The boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together.[5430] Poirot had been asked by John to remain to lunch, and was already[5431] seated at the table.[5432] [13]
[5433] By tacit consent, all mention of the tragedy was barred. We conversed[5434] on the war, and other outside topics. But after the cheese and biscuits[5435] had been handed round, and Dorcas had left the room, Poirot suddenly[5436] leant forward to Mrs. Cavendish.[5437] [13]
[5438] “Pardon me, madame, for recalling unpleasant memories, but I have a[5439] little idea”—Poirot’s “little ideas” were becoming a perfect[5440] byword—“and would like to ask one or two questions.”[5441] [13]
[5442] “Of me? Certainly.”[5443] [13]
[5444] “You are too amiable, madame. What I want to ask is this: the door[5445] leading into Mrs. Inglethorp’s room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia,[5446] it was bolted, you say?”[5447] [13]
[5448] “Certainly it was bolted,” replied Mary Cavendish, rather surprised. “I[5449] said so at the inquest.”[5450] [13]
[5451] “Bolted?”[5452] [13]
[5453] “Yes.” She looked perplexed.[5454] [13]
[5455] “I mean,” explained Poirot, “you are sure it was bolted, and not merely[5456] locked?”[5457] [13]
[5458] “Oh, I see what you mean. No, I don’t know. I said bolted, meaning that[5459] it was fastened, and I could not open it, but I believe all the doors[5460] were found bolted on the inside.”[5461] [13]
[5462] “Still, as far as you are concerned, the door might equally well have[5463] been locked?”[5464] [13]
[5465] “Oh, yes.”[5466] [13]
[5467] “You yourself did not happen to notice, madame, when you entered Mrs.[5468] Inglethorp’s room, whether that door was bolted or not?”[5469] [13]
[5470] “I—I believe it was.”[5471] [13]
[5472] “But you did not see it?”[5473] [13]
[5474] “No. I—never looked.”[5475] [13]
[5476] “But _I_ did,” interrupted Lawrence suddenly. “I happened to notice[5477] that it _was_ bolted.”[5478] [13]
[5479] “Ah, that settles it.” And Poirot looked crestfallen.[5480] [13]
[5481] I could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his “little ideas”[5482] had come to naught.[5483] [13]
[5484] After lunch Poirot begged me to accompany him home. I consented rather[5485] stiffly.[5486] [13]
[5487] “You are annoyed, is it not so?” he asked anxiously, as we walked[5488] through the park.[5489] [13]
[5490] “Not at all,” I said coldly.[5491] [13]
[5492] “That is well. That lifts a great load from my mind.”[5493] [13]
[5494] This was not quite what I had intended. I had hoped that he would have[5495] observed the stiffness of my manner. Still, the fervour of his words[5496] went towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. I thawed.[5497] [13]
[5498] “I gave Lawrence your message,” I said.[5499] [13]
[5500] “And what did he say? He was entirely puzzled?”[5501] [13]
[5502] “Yes. I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant.”[5503] [13]
[5504] I had expected Poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he[5505] replied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad. My[5506] pride forbade me to ask any questions.[5507] [13]
[5508] Poirot switched off on another tack.[5509] [13]
[5510] “Mademoiselle Cynthia was not at lunch to-day? How was that?”[5511] [13]
[5512] “She is at the hospital again. She resumed work to-day.”[5513] [13]
[5514] “Ah, she is an industrious little demoiselle. And pretty too. She is[5515] like pictures I have seen in Italy. I would rather like to see that[5516] dispensary of hers. Do you think she would show it to me?”[5517] [13]
[5518] “I am sure she would be delighted. It’s an interesting little place.”[5519] [13]
[5520] “Does she go there every day?”[5521] [13]
[5522] “She has all Wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on Saturdays.[5523] Those are her only times off.”[5524] [13]
[5525] “I will remember. Women are doing great work nowadays, and Mademoiselle[5526] Cynthia is clever—oh, yes, she has brains, that little one.”[5527] [13]
[5528] “Yes. I believe she has passed quite a stiff exam.”[5529] [13]
[5530] “Without doubt. After all, it is very responsible work. I suppose they[5531] have very strong poisons there?”[5532] [13]
[5533] “Yes, she showed them to us. They are kept locked up in a little[5534] cupboard. I believe they have to be very careful. They always take out[5535] the key before leaving the room.”[5536] [13]
[5537] “Indeed. It is near the window, this cupboard?”[5538] [13]
[5539] “No, right the other side of the room. Why?”[5540] [13]
[5541] Poirot shrugged his shoulders.[5542] [13]
[5543] “I wondered. That is all. Will you come in?”[5544] [13]
[5545] We had reached the cottage.[5546] [13]
[5547] “No. I think I’ll be getting back. I shall go round the long way[5548] through the woods.”[5549] [13]
[5550] The woods round Styles were very beautiful. After the walk across the[5551] open park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades.[5552] There was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was[5553] faint and subdued. I strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself[5554] down at the foot of a grand old beech-tree. My thoughts of mankind were[5555] kindly and charitable. I even forgave Poirot for his absurd secrecy. In[5556] fact, I was at peace with the world. Then I yawned.[5557] [13]
[5558] I thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and[5559] far off.[5560] [13]
[5561] I yawned again.[5562] [13]
[5563] Probably, I thought, it really never happened. Of course, it was all a[5564] bad dream. The truth of the matter was that it was Lawrence who had[5565] murdered Alfred Inglethorp with a croquet mallet. But it was absurd of[5566] John to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out: “I tell you[5567] I won’t have it!”[5568] [13]
[5569] I woke up with a start.[5570] [13]
[5571] At once I realized that I was in a very awkward predicament. For, about[5572] twelve feet away from me, John and Mary Cavendish were standing facing[5573] each other, and they were evidently quarrelling. And, quite as[5574] evidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before I could move or[5575] speak John repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream.[5576] [13]
[5577] “I tell you, Mary, I won’t have it.”[5578] [13]
[5579] Mary’s voice came, cool and liquid:[5580] [13]
[5581] “Have _you_ any right to criticize my actions?”[5582] [13]
[5583] “It will be the talk of the village! My mother was only buried on[5584] Saturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow.”[5585] [13]
[5586] “Oh,” she shrugged her shoulders, “if it is only village gossip that[5587] you mind!”[5588] [13]
[5589] “But it isn’t. I’ve had enough of the fellow hanging about. He’s a[5590] Polish Jew, anyway.”[5591] [13]
[5592] “A tinge of Jewish blood is not a bad thing. It leavens the”—she looked[5593] at him—“stolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman.”[5594] [13]
[5595] Fire in her eyes, ice in her voice. I did not wonder that the blood[5596] rose to John’s face in a crimson tide.[5597] [13]
[5598] “Mary!”[5599] [13]
[5600] “Well?” Her tone did not change.[5601] [13]
[5602] The pleading died out of his voice.[5603] [13]
[5604] “Am I to understand that you will continue to see Bauerstein against my[5605] express wishes?”[5606] [13]
[5607] “If I choose.”[5608] [13]
[5609] “You defy me?”[5610] [13]
[5611] “No, but I deny your right to criticize my actions. Have _you_ no[5612] friends of whom I should disapprove?”[5613] [13]
[5614] John fell back a pace. The colour ebbed slowly from his face.[5615] [13]
[5616] “What do you mean?” he said, in an unsteady voice.[5617] [13]
[5618] “You see!” said Mary quietly. “You _do_ see, don’t you, that _you_ have[5619] no right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends?”[5620] [13]
[5621] John glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face.[5622] [13]
[5623] “No right? Have I _no_ right, Mary?” he said unsteadily. He stretched[5624] out his hands. “Mary——”[5625] [13]
[5626] For a moment, I thought she wavered. A softer expression came over her[5627] face, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away.[5628] [13]
[5629] “None!”[5630] [13]
[5631] She was walking away when John sprang after her, and caught her by the[5632] arm.[5633] [13]
[5634] “Mary”—his voice was very quiet now—“are you in love with this fellow[5635] Bauerstein?”[5636] [13]
[5637] She hesitated, and suddenly there swept across her face a strange[5638] expression, old as the hills, yet with something eternally young about[5639] it. So might some Egyptian sphinx have smiled.[5640] [13]
[5641] She freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder.[5642] [13]
[5643] “Perhaps,” she said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade,[5644] leaving John standing there as though he had been turned to stone.[5645] [13]
[5646] Rather ostentatiously, I stepped forward, crackling some dead branches[5647] with my feet as I did so. John turned. Luckily, he took it for granted[5648] that I had only just come upon the scene.[5649] [13]
[5650] “Hullo, Hastings. Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his[5651] cottage? Quaint little chap! Is he any good, though, really?”[5652] [13]
[5653] “He was considered one of the finest detectives of his day.”[5654] [13]
[5655] “Oh, well, I suppose there must be something in it, then. What a rotten[5656] world it is, though!”[5657] [13]
[5658] “You find it so?” I asked.[5659] [13]
[5660] “Good Lord, yes! There’s this terrible business to start with. Scotland[5661] Yard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box! Never know[5662] where they won’t turn up next. Screaming headlines in every paper in[5663] the country—damn all journalists, I say! Do you know there was a whole[5664] crowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning. Sort of Madame[5665] Tussaud’s chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing.[5666] Pretty thick, isn’t it?”[5667] [13]
[5668] “Cheer up, John!” I said soothingly. “It can’t last for ever.”[5669] [13]
[5670] “Can’t it, though? It can last long enough for us never to be able to[5671] hold up our heads again.”[5672] [13]
[5673] “No, no, you’re getting morbid on the subject.”[5674] [13]
[5675] “Enough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and[5676] stared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes! But there’s[5677] worse than that.”[5678] [13]
[5679] “What?”[5680] [13]
[5681] John lowered his voice:[5682] [13]
[5683] “Have you ever thought, Hastings—it’s a nightmare to me—who did it? I[5684] can’t help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident.[5685] Because—because—who could have done it? Now Inglethorp’s out of the[5686] way, there’s no one else; no one, I mean, except—one of us.”[5687] [13]
[5688] Yes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! One of us? Yes,[5689] surely it must be so, unless——-[5690] [13]
[5691] A new idea suggested itself to my mind. Rapidly, I considered it. The[5692] light increased. Poirot’s mysterious doings, his hints—they all fitted[5693] in. Fool that I was not to have thought of this possibility before, and[5694] what a relief for us all.[5695] [13]
[5696] “No, John,” I said, “it isn’t one of us. How could it be?”[5697] [13]
[5698] “I know, but, still, who else is there?”[5699] [13]
[5700] “Can’t you guess?”[5701] [13]
[5702] “No.”[5703] [13]
[5704] I looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice.[5705] [13]
[5706] “Dr. Bauerstein!” I whispered.[5707] [13]
[5708] “Impossible!”[5709] [13]
[5710] “Not at all.”[5711] [13]
[5712] “But what earthly interest could he have in my mother’s death?”[5713] [13]
[5714] “That I don’t see,” I confessed, “but I’ll tell you this: Poirot thinks[5715] so.”[5716] [13]
[5717] “Poirot? Does he? How do you know?”[5718] [13]
[5719] I told him of Poirot’s intense excitement on hearing that Dr.[5720] Bauerstein had been at Styles on the fatal night, and added:[5721] [13]
[5722] “He said twice: ‘That alters everything.’ And I’ve been thinking. You[5723] know Inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall? Well, it[5724] was just then that Bauerstein arrived. Isn’t it possible that, as[5725] Inglethorp brought him through the hall, the doctor dropped something[5726] into the coffee in passing?”[5727] [13]
[5728] “H’m,” said John. “It would have been very risky.”[5729] [13]
[5730] “Yes, but it was possible.”[5731] [13]
[5732] “And then, how could he know it was her coffee? No, old fellow, I don’t[5733] think that will wash.”[5734] [13]
[5735] But I had remembered something else.[5736] [13]
[5737] “You’re quite right. That wasn’t how it was done. Listen.” And I then[5738] told him of the cocoa sample which Poirot had taken to be analysed.[5739] [13]
[5740] John interrupted just as I had done.[5741] [13]
[5742] “But, look here, Bauerstein had had it analysed already?”[5743] [13]
[5744] “Yes, yes, that’s the point. I didn’t see it either until now. Don’t[5745] you understand? Bauerstein had it analysed—that’s just it! If[5746] Bauerstein’s the murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him to[5747] substitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample, and send that to be[5748] tested. And of course they would find no strychnine! But no one would[5749] dream of suspecting Bauerstein, or think of taking another[5750] sample—except Poirot,” I added, with belated recognition.[5751] [13]
[5752] “Yes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won’t disguise?”[5753] [13]
[5754] “Well, we’ve only his word for that. And there are other possibilities.[5755] He’s admittedly one of the world’s greatest toxicologists——”[5756] [13]
[5757] “One of the world’s greatest what? Say it again.”[5758] [13]
[5759] “He knows more about poisons than almost anybody,” I explained. “Well,[5760] my idea is, that perhaps he’s found some way of making strychnine[5761] tasteless. Or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure[5762] drug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms.”[5763] [13]
[5764] “H’m, yes, that might be,” said John. “But look here, how could he have[5765] got at the cocoa? That wasn’t downstairs?”[5766] [13]
[5767] “No, it wasn’t,” I admitted reluctantly.[5768] [13]
[5769] And then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. I[5770] hoped and prayed it would not occur to John also. I glanced sideways at[5771] him. He was frowning perplexedly, and I drew a deep breath of relief,[5772] for the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that[5773] Dr. Bauerstein might have had an accomplice.[5774] [13]
[5775] Yet surely it could not be! Surely no woman as beautiful as Mary[5776] Cavendish could be a murderess. Yet beautiful women had been known to[5777] poison.[5778] [13]
[5779] And suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of[5780] my arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a[5781] woman’s weapon. How agitated she had been on that fatal Tuesday[5782] evening! Had Mrs. Inglethorp discovered something between her and[5783] Bauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband? Was it to stop that[5784] denunciation that the crime had been committed?[5785] [13]
[5786] Then I remembered that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and[5787] Evelyn Howard. Was this what they had meant? Was this the monstrous[5788] possibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe?[5789] [13]
[5790] Yes, it all fitted in.[5791] [13]
[5792] No wonder Miss Howard had suggested “hushing it up.” Now I understood[5793] that unfinished sentence of hers: “Emily herself——” And in my heart I[5794] agreed with her. Would not Mrs. Inglethorp have preferred to go[5795] unavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name[5796] of Cavendish.[5797] [13]
[5798] “There’s another thing,” said John suddenly, and the unexpected sound[5799] of his voice made me start guiltily. “Something which makes me doubt if[5800] what you say can be true.”[5801] [13]
[5802] “What’s that?” I asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject[5803] of how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa.[5804] [13]
[5805] “Why, the fact that Bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. He needn’t have[5806] done so. Little Wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at[5807] heart disease.”[5808] [13]
[5809] “Yes,” I said doubtfully. “But we don’t know. Perhaps he thought it[5810] safer in the long run. Someone might have talked afterwards. Then the[5811] Home Office might have ordered exhumation. The whole thing would have[5812] come out, then, and he would have been in an awkward position, for no[5813] one would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been[5814] deceived into calling it heart disease.”[5815] [13]
[5816] “Yes, that’s possible,” admitted John. “Still,” he added, “I’m blest if[5817] I can see what his motive could have been.”[5818] [13]
[5819] I trembled.[5820] [13]
[5821] “Look here,” I said, “I may be altogether wrong. And, remember, all[5822] this is in confidence.”[5823] [13]
[5824] “Oh, of course—that goes without saying.”[5825] [13]
[5826] We had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate[5827] into the garden. Voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under[5828] the sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival.[5829] [13]
[5830] Cynthia was back from the hospital, and I placed my chair beside her,[5831] and told her of Poirot’s wish to visit the dispensary.[5832] [13]
[5833] “Of course! I’d love him to see it. He’d better come to tea there one[5834] day. I must fix it up with him. He’s such a dear little man! But he[5835] _is_ funny. He made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and[5836] put it in again, because he said it wasn’t straight.”[5837] [13]
[5838] I laughed.[5839] [13]
[5840] “It’s quite a mania with him.”[5841] [13]
[5842] “Yes, isn’t it?”[5843] [13]
[5844] We were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction[5845] of Mary Cavendish, and dropping her voice, Cynthia said:[5846] [13]
[5847] “Mr. Hastings.”[5848] [13]
[5849] “Yes?”[5850] [13]
[5851] “After tea, I want to talk to you.”[5852] [13]
[5853] Her glance at Mary had set me thinking. I fancied that between these[5854] two there existed very little sympathy. For the first time, it occurred[5855] to me to wonder about the girl’s future. Mrs. Inglethorp had made no[5856] provisions of any kind for her, but I imagined that John and Mary would[5857] probably insist on her making her home with them—at any rate until the[5858] end of the war. John, I knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry[5859] to let her go.[5860] [13]
[5861] John, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. His good-natured[5862] face wore an unaccustomed frown of anger.[5863] [13]
[5864] “Confound those detectives! I can’t think what they’re after! They’ve[5865] been in every room in the house—turning things inside out, and upside[5866] down. It really is too bad! I suppose they took advantage of our all[5867] being out. I shall go for that fellow Japp, when I next see him!”[5868] [13]
[5869] “Lot of Paul Prys,” grunted Miss Howard.[5870] [13]
[5871] Lawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something.[5872] [13]
[5873] Mary Cavendish said nothing.[5874] [13]
[5875] After tea, I invited Cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off[5876] into the woods together.[5877] [13]
[5878] “Well?” I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by[5879] the leafy screen.[5880] [13]
[5881] With a sigh, Cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her hat. The[5882] sunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair[5883] to quivering gold.[5884] [13]
[5885] “Mr. Hastings—you are always so kind, and you know such a lot.”[5886] [13]
[5887] It struck me at this moment that Cynthia was really a very charming[5888] girl! Much more charming than Mary, who never said things of that kind.[5889] [13]
[5890] “Well?” I asked benignantly, as she hesitated.[5891] [13]
[5892] “I want to ask your advice. What shall I do?”[5893] [13]
[5894] “Do?”[5895] [13]
[5896] “Yes. You see, Aunt Emily always told me I should be provided for. I[5897] suppose she forgot, or didn’t think she was likely to die—anyway, I am[5898] _not_ provided for! And I don’t know what to do. Do you think I ought[5899] to go away from here at once?”[5900] [13]
[5901] “Good heavens, no! They don’t want to part with you, I’m sure.”[5902] [13]
[5903] Cynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands.[5904] Then she said: “Mrs. Cavendish does. She hates me.”[5905] [13]
[5906] “Hates you?” I cried, astonished.[5907] [13]
[5908] Cynthia nodded.[5909] [13]
[5910] “Yes. I don’t know why, but she can’t bear me; and _he_ can’t, either.”[5911] [13]
[5912] “There I know you’re wrong,” I said warmly. “On the contrary, John is[5913] very fond of you.”[5914] [13]
[5915] “Oh, yes—_John_. I meant Lawrence. Not, of course, that I care whether[5916] Lawrence hates me or not. Still, it’s rather horrid when no one loves[5917] you, isn’t it?”[5918] [13]
[5919] “But they do, Cynthia dear,” I said earnestly. “I’m sure you are[5920] mistaken. Look, there is John—and Miss Howard——”[5921] [13]
[5922] Cynthia nodded rather gloomily. “Yes, John likes me, I think, and of[5923] course Evie, for all her gruff ways, wouldn’t be unkind to a fly. But[5924] Lawrence never speaks to me if he can help it, and Mary can hardly[5925] bring herself to be civil to me. She wants Evie to stay on, is begging[5926] her to, but she doesn’t want me, and—and—I don’t know what to do.”[5927] Suddenly the poor child burst out crying.[5928] [13]
[5929] I don’t know what possessed me. Her beauty, perhaps, as she sat there,[5930] with the sunlight glinting down on her head; perhaps the sense of[5931] relief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no[5932] connection with the tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her youth and[5933] loneliness. Anyway, I leant forward, and taking her little hand, I said[5934] awkwardly:[5935] [13]
[5936] “Marry me, Cynthia.”[5937] [13]
[5938] Unwittingly, I had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears. She sat[5939] up at once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity:[5940] [13]
[5941] “Don’t be silly!”[5942] [13]
[5943] I was a little annoyed.[5944] [13]
[5945] “I’m not being silly. I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming[5946] my wife.”[5947] [13]
[5948] To my intense surprise, Cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a[5949] “funny dear.”[5950] [13]
[5951] “It’s perfectly sweet of you,” she said, “but you know you don’t want[5952] to!”[5953] [13]
[5954] “Yes, I do. I’ve got——”[5955] [13]
[5956] “Never mind what you’ve got. You don’t really want to—and I don’t[5957] either.”[5958] [13]
[5959] “Well, of course, that settles it,” I said stiffly. “But I don’t see[5960] anything to laugh at. There’s nothing funny about a proposal.”[5961] [13]
[5962] “No, indeed,” said Cynthia. “Somebody might accept you next time.[5963] Good-bye, you’ve cheered me up _very_ much.”[5964] [13]
[5965] And, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished[5966] through the trees.[5967] [13]
[5968] Thinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly[5969] unsatisfactory.[5970] [13]
[5971] It occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village, and[5972] look up Bauerstein. Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow.[5973] At the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might[5974] have as to his being suspected. I remembered how Poirot had relied on[5975] my diplomacy. Accordingly, I went to the little house with the[5976] “Apartments” card inserted in the window, where I knew he lodged, and[5977] tapped on the door.[5978] [13]
[5979] An old woman came and opened it.[5980] [13]
[5981] “Good afternoon,” I said pleasantly. “Is Dr. Bauerstein in?”[5982] [13]
[5983] She stared at me.[5984] [13]
[5985] “Haven’t you heard?”[5986] [13]
[5987] “Heard what?”[5988] [13]
[5989] “About him.”[5990] [13]
[5991] “What about him?”[5992] [13]
[5993] “He’s took.”[5994] [13]
[5995] “Took? Dead?”[5996] [13]
[5997] “No, took by the perlice.”[5998] [13]
[5999] “By the police!” I gasped. “Do you mean they’ve arrested him?”[6000] [13]
[6001] “Yes, that’s it, and——”[6002] [13]
[6003] I waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find Poirot.[6004] [13]
[6005] [13]
[6006] [13]
[6007] [13]
[6008] CHAPTER X.[6009] THE ARREST[6010] [13]
[6011] [13]
[6012] To my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who[6013] answered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London.[6014] [13]
[6015] I was dumbfounded. What on earth could Poirot be doing in London! Was[6016] it a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind[6017] when he parted from me a few hours earlier?[6018] [13]
[6019] I retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance. With Poirot away, I[6020] was uncertain how to act. Had he foreseen this arrest? Had he not, in[6021] all probability, been the cause of it? Those questions I could not[6022] resolve. But in the meantime what was I to do? Should I announce the[6023] arrest openly at Styles, or not? Though I did not acknowledge it to[6024] myself, the thought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me. Would it not[6025] be a terrible shock to her? For the moment, I set aside utterly any[6026] suspicions of her. She could not be implicated—otherwise I should have[6027] heard some hint of it.[6028] [13]
[6029] Of course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to[6030] conceal Dr. Bauerstein’s arrest from her. It would be announced in[6031] every newspaper on the morrow. Still, I shrank from blurting it out. If[6032] only Poirot had been accessible, I could have asked his advice. What[6033] possessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way?[6034] [13]
[6035] In spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably[6036] heightened. I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not[6037] Poirot put it into my head. Yes, decidedly, the little man was clever.[6038] [13]
[6039] After some reflecting, I decided to take John into my confidence, and[6040] leave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit.[6041] [13]
[6042] He gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news.[6043] [13]
[6044] “Great Scott! You _were_ right, then. I couldn’t believe it at the[6045] time.”[6046] [13]
[6047] “No, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it[6048] makes everything fit in. Now, what are we to do? Of course, it will be[6049] generally known to-morrow.”[6050] [13]
[6051] John reflected.[6052] [13]
[6053] “Never mind,” he said at last, “we won’t say anything at present. There[6054] is no need. As you say, it will be known soon enough.”[6055] [13]
[6056] But to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and[6057] eagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest![6058] There was a column of mere padding about “The Styles Poisoning Case,”[6059] but nothing further. It was rather inexplicable, but I supposed that,[6060] for some reason or other, Japp wished to keep it out of the papers. It[6061] worried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there[6062] might be further arrests to come.[6063] [13]
[6064] After breakfast, I decided to go down to the village, and see if Poirot[6065] had returned yet; but, before I could start, a well-known face blocked[6066] one of the windows, and the well-known voice said:[6067] [13]
[6068] “_Bonjour, mon ami!_”[6069] [13]
[6070] “Poirot,” I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, I[6071] dragged him into the room. “I was never so glad to see anyone. Listen,[6072] I have said nothing to anybody but John. Is that right?”[6073] [13]
[6074] “My friend,” replied Poirot, “I do not know what you are talking[6075] about.”[6076] [13]
[6077] “Dr. Bauerstein’s arrest, of course,” I answered impatiently.[6078] [13]
[6079] “Is Bauerstein arrested, then?”[6080] [13]
[6081] “Did you not know it?”[6082] [13]
[6083] “Not the least in the world.” But, pausing a moment, he added: “Still,[6084] it does not surprise me. After all, we are only four miles from the[6085] coast.”[6086] [13]
[6087] “The coast?” I asked, puzzled. “What has that got to do with it?”[6088] [13]
[6089] Poirot shrugged his shoulders.[6090] [13]
[6091] “Surely, it is obvious!”[6092] [13]
[6093] “Not to me. No doubt I am very dense, but I cannot see what the[6094] proximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs.[6095] Inglethorp.”[6096] [13]
[6097] “Nothing at all, of course,” replied Poirot, smiling. “But we were[6098] speaking of the arrest of Dr. Bauerstein.”[6099] [13]
[6100] “Well, he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp——”[6101] [13]
[6102] “What?” cried Poirot, in apparently lively astonishment. “Dr.[6103] Bauerstein arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp?”[6104] [13]
[6105] “Yes.”[6106] [13]
[6107] “Impossible! That would be too good a farce! Who told you that, my[6108] friend?”[6109] [13]
[6110] “Well, no one exactly told me,” I confessed. “But he is arrested.”[6111] [13]
[6112] “Oh, yes, very likely. But for espionage, _mon ami_.”[6113] [13]
[6114] “Espionage?” I gasped.[6115] [13]
[6116] “Precisely.”[6117] [13]
[6118] “Not for poisoning Mrs. Inglethorp?”[6119] [13]
[6120] “Not unless our friend Japp has taken leave of his senses,” replied[6121] Poirot placidly.[6122] [13]
[6123] “But—but I thought you thought so too?”[6124] [13]
[6125] Poirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his full[6126] sense of the utter absurdity of such an idea.[6127] [13]
[6128] “Do you mean to say,” I asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea,[6129] “that Dr. Bauerstein is a spy?”[6130] [13]
[6131] Poirot nodded.[6132] [13]
[6133] “Have you never suspected it?”[6134] [13]
[6135] “It never entered my head.”[6136] [13]
[6137] “It did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should[6138] bury himself in a little village like this, and should be in the habit[6139] of walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed?”[6140] [13]
[6141] “No,” I confessed, “I never thought of such a thing.”[6142] [13]
[6143] “He is, of course, a German by birth,” said Poirot thoughtfully,[6144] “though he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of[6145] him as anything but an Englishman. He was naturalized about fifteen[6146] years ago. A very clever man—a Jew, of course.”[6147] [13]
[6148] “The blackguard!” I cried indignantly.[6149] [13]
[6150] “Not at all. He is, on the contrary, a patriot. Think what he stands to[6151] lose. I admire the man myself.”[6152] [13]
[6153] But I could not look at it in Poirot’s philosophical way.[6154] [13]
[6155] “And this is the man with whom Mrs. Cavendish has been wandering about[6156] all over the country!” I cried indignantly.[6157] [13]
[6158] “Yes. I should fancy he had found her very useful,” remarked Poirot.[6159] “So long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any[6160] other vagaries of the doctor’s passed unobserved.”[6161] [13]
[6162] “Then you think he never really cared for her?” I asked eagerly—rather[6163] too eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances.[6164] [13]
[6165] “That, of course, I cannot say, but—shall I tell you my own private[6166] opinion, Hastings?”[6167] [13]
[6168] “Yes.”[6169] [13]
[6170] “Well, it is this: that Mrs. Cavendish does not care, and never has[6171] cared one little jot about Dr. Bauerstein!”[6172] [13]
[6173] “Do you really think so?” I could not disguise my pleasure.[6174] [13]
[6175] “I am quite sure of it. And I will tell you why.”[6176] [13]
[6177] “Yes?”[6178] [13]
[6179] “Because she cares for someone else, _mon ami_.”[6180] [13]
[6181] “Oh!” What did he mean? In spite of myself, an agreeable warmth spread[6182] over me. I am not a vain man where women are concerned, but I[6183] remembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time,[6184] perhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate——[6185] [13]
[6186] My pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss[6187] Howard. She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in[6188] the room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. This she[6189] handed to Poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words:[6190] [13]
[6191] “On top of the wardrobe.” Then she hurriedly left the room.[6192] [13]
[6193] Poirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation[6194] of satisfaction. He spread it out on the table.[6195] [13]
[6196] “Come here, Hastings. Now tell me, what is that initial—J. or L.?”[6197] [13]
[6198] It was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had[6199] lain by for some time. But it was the label that was attracting[6200] Poirot’s attention. At the top, it bore the printed stamp of Messrs.[6201] Parkson’s, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed[6202] to “—(the debatable initial) Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court, Styles St.[6203] Mary, Essex.”[6204] [13]
[6205] “It might be T., or it might be L.,” I said, after studying the thing[6206] for a minute or two. “It certainly isn’t a J.”[6207] [13]
[6208] “Good,” replied Poirot, folding up the paper again. “I, also, am of[6209] your way of thinking. It is an L., depend upon it!”[6210] [13]
[6211] “Where did it come from?” I asked curiously. “Is it important?”[6212] [13]
[6213] “Moderately so. It confirms a surmise of mine. Having deduced its[6214] existence, I set Miss Howard to search for it, and, as you see, she has[6215] been successful.”[6216] [13]
[6217] “What did she mean by ‘On the top of the wardrobe’?”[6218] [13]
[6219] “She meant,” replied Poirot promptly, “that she found it on top of a[6220] wardrobe.”[6221] [13]
[6222] “A funny place for a piece of brown paper,” I mused.[6223] [13]
[6224] “Not at all. The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown[6225] paper and cardboard boxes. I have kept them there myself. Neatly[6226] arranged, there is nothing to offend the eye.”[6227] [13]
[6228] “Poirot,” I asked earnestly, “have you made up your mind about this[6229] crime?”[6230] [13]
[6231] “Yes—that is to say, I believe I know how it was committed.”[6232] [13]
[6233] “Ah!”[6234] [13]
[6235] “Unfortunately, I have no proof beyond my surmise, unless——” With[6236] sudden energy, he caught me by the arm, and whirled me down the hall,[6237] calling out in French in his excitement: “Mademoiselle Dorcas,[6238] Mademoiselle Dorcas, _un moment, s’il vous plaît!_”[6239] [13]
[6240] Dorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the pantry.[6241] [13]
[6242] “My good Dorcas, I have an idea—a little idea—if it should prove[6243] justified, what magnificent chance! Tell me, on Monday, not Tuesday,[6244] Dorcas, but Monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong[6245] with Mrs. Inglethorp’s bell?”[6246] [13]
[6247] Dorcas looked very surprised.[6248] [13]
[6249] “Yes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I don’t know how you came[6250] to hear of it. A mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire[6251] through. The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning.”[6252] [13]
[6253] With a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, Poirot led the way back to[6254] the morning-room.[6255] [13]
[6256] “See you, one should not ask for outside proof—no, reason should be[6257] enough. But the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on[6258] the right track. Ah, my friend, I am like a giant refreshed. I run! I[6259] leap!”[6260] [13]
[6261] And, in very truth, run and leap he did, gambolling wildly down the[6262] stretch of lawn outside the long window.[6263] [13]
[6264] “What is your remarkable little friend doing?” asked a voice behind me,[6265] and I turned to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow. She smiled, and so did[6266] I. “What is it all about?”[6267] [13]
[6268] “Really, I can’t tell you. He asked Dorcas some question about a bell,[6269] and appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as[6270] you see!”[6271] [13]
[6272] Mary laughed.[6273] [13]
[6274] “How ridiculous! He’s going out of the gate. Isn’t he coming back[6275] to-day?”[6276] [13]
[6277] “I don’t know. I’ve given up trying to guess what he’ll do next.”[6278] [13]
[6279] “Is he quite mad, Mr. Hastings?”[6280] [13]
[6281] “I honestly don’t know. Sometimes, I feel sure he is as mad as a[6282] hatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, I find there is method[6283] in his madness.”[6284] [13]
[6285] “I see.”[6286] [13]
[6287] In spite of her laugh, Mary was looking thoughtful this morning. She[6288] seemed grave, almost sad.[6289] [13]
[6290] It occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on[6291] the subject of Cynthia. I began rather tactfully, _I_ thought, but I[6292] had not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.[6293] [13]
[6294] “You are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings, but in[6295] this case your talents are quite thrown away. Cynthia will run no risk[6296] of encountering any unkindness from me.”[6297] [13]
[6298] I began to stammer feebly that I hoped she hadn’t thought—— But again[6299] she stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove[6300] Cynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind.[6301] [13]
[6302] “Mr. Hastings,” she said, “do you think I and my husband are happy[6303] together?”[6304] [13]
[6305] I was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about it’s not[6306] being my business to think anything of the sort.[6307] [13]
[6308] “Well,” she said quietly, “whether it is your business or not, I will[6309] tell you that we are _not_ happy.”[6310] [13]
[6311] I said nothing, for I saw that she had not finished.[6312] [13]
[6313] She began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a little bent,[6314] and that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked. She[6315] stopped suddenly, and looked up at me.[6316] [13]
[6317] “You don’t know anything about me, do you?” she asked. “Where I come[6318] from, who I was before I married John—anything, in fact? Well, I will[6319] tell you. I will make a father confessor of you. You are kind, I[6320] think—yes, I am sure you are kind.”[6321] [13]
[6322] Somehow, I was not quite as elated as I might have been. I remembered[6323] that Cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way. Besides, a[6324] father confessor should be elderly, it is not at all the role for a[6325] young man.[6326] [13]
[6327] “My father was English,” said Mrs. Cavendish, “but my mother was a[6328] Russian.”[6329] [13]
[6330] “Ah,” I said, “now I understand——”[6331] [13]
[6332] “Understand what?”[6333] [13]
[6334] “A hint of something foreign—different—that there has always been about[6335] you.”[6336] [13]
[6337] “My mother was very beautiful, I believe. I don’t know, because I never[6338] saw her. She died when I was quite a little child. I believe there was[6339] some tragedy connected with her death—she took an overdose of some[6340] sleeping draught by mistake. However that may be, my father was[6341] broken-hearted. Shortly afterwards, he went into the Consular Service.[6342] Everywhere he went, I went with him. When I was twenty-three, I had[6343] been nearly all over the world. It was a splendid life—I loved it.”[6344] [13]
[6345] There was a smile on her face, and her head was thrown back. She seemed[6346] living in the memory of those old glad days.[6347] [13]
[6348] “Then my father died. He left me very badly off. I had to go and live[6349] with some old aunts in Yorkshire.” She shuddered. “You will understand[6350] me when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had[6351] been. The narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad.”[6352] She paused a minute, and added in a different tone: “And then I met[6353] John Cavendish.”[6354] [13]
[6355] “Yes?”[6356] [13]
[6357] “You can imagine that, from my aunts’ point of view, it was a very good[6358] match for me. But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed[6359] with me. No, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable[6360] monotony of my life.”[6361] [13]
[6362] I said nothing, and after a moment, she went on:[6363] [13]
[6364] “Don’t misunderstand me. I was quite honest with him. I told him, what[6365] was true, that I liked him very much, that I hoped to come to like him[6366] more, but that I was not in any way what the world calls ‘in love’ with[6367] him. He declared that that satisfied him, and so—we were married.”[6368] [13]
[6369] She waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her forehead.[6370] She seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days.[6371] [13]
[6372] “I think—I am sure—he cared for me at first. But I suppose we were not[6373] well matched. Almost at once, we drifted apart. He—it is not a pleasing[6374] thing for my pride, but it is the truth—tired of me very soon.” I must[6375] have made some murmur of dissent, for she went on quickly: “Oh, yes, he[6376] did! Not that it matters now—now that we’ve come to the parting of the[6377] ways.”[6378] [13]
[6379] “What do you mean?”[6380] [13]
[6381] She answered quietly:[6382] [13]
[6383] “I mean that I am not going to remain at Styles.”[6384] [13]
[6385] “You and John are not going to live here?”[6386] [13]
[6387] “John may live here, but I shall not.”[6388] [13]
[6389] “You are going to leave him?”[6390] [13]
[6391] “Yes.”[6392] [13]
[6393] “But why?”[6394] [13]
[6395] She paused a long time, and said at last:[6396] [13]
[6397] “Perhaps—because I want to be—free!”[6398] [13]
[6399] And, as she spoke, I had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin tracts[6400] of forests, untrodden lands—and a realization of what freedom would[6401] mean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish. I seemed to see her for a[6402] moment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as[6403] some shy bird of the hills. A little cry broke from her lips:[6404] [13]
[6405] “You don’t know, you don’t know, how this hateful place has been prison[6406] to me!”[6407] [13]
[6408] “I understand,” I said, “but—but don’t do anything rash.”[6409] [13]
[6410] “Oh, rash!” Her voice mocked at my prudence.[6411] [13]
[6412] Then suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue for:[6413] [13]
[6414] “You know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested?”[6415] [13]
[6416] An instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting out all[6417] expression.[6418] [13]
[6419] “John was so kind as to break that to me this morning.”[6420] [13]
[6421] “Well, what do you think?” I asked feebly.[6422] [13]
[6423] “Of what?”[6424] [13]
[6425] “Of the arrest?”[6426] [13]
[6427] “What should I think? Apparently he is a German spy; so the gardener[6428] had told John.”[6429] [13]
[6430] Her face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. Did she[6431] care, or did she not?[6432] [13]
[6433] She moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower vases.[6434] [13]
[6435] “These are quite dead. I must do them again. Would you mind[6436] moving—thank you, Mr. Hastings.” And she walked quietly past me out of[6437] the window, with a cool little nod of dismissal.[6438] [13]
[6439] No, surely she could not care for Bauerstein. No woman could act her[6440] part with that icy unconcern.[6441] [13]
[6442] Poirot did not make his appearance the following morning, and there was[6443] no sign of the Scotland Yard men.[6444] [13]
[6445] But, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence—or rather[6446] lack of evidence. We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which[6447] Mrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death. Our[6448] efforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that[6449] it might turn up of itself one day. And this is just what did happen,[6450] in the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from[6451] a firm of French music publishers, acknowledging Mrs. Inglethorp’s[6452] cheque, and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series[6453] of Russian folksongs. So the last hope of solving the mystery, by means[6454] of Mrs. Inglethorp’s correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be[6455] abandoned.[6456] [13]
[6457] Just before tea, I strolled down to tell Poirot of the new[6458] disappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he was once more out.[6459] [13]
[6460] “Gone to London again?”[6461] [13]
[6462] “Oh, no, monsieur, he has but taken the train to Tadminster. ‘To see a[6463] young lady’s dispensary,’ he said.”[6464] [13]
[6465] “Silly ass!” I ejaculated. “I told him Wednesday was the one day she[6466] wasn’t there! Well, tell him to look us up to-morrow morning, will[6467] you?”[6468] [13]
[6469] “Certainly, monsieur.”[6470] [13]
[6471] But, on the following day, no sign of Poirot. I was getting angry. He[6472] was really treating us in the most cavalier fashion.[6473] [13]
[6474] After lunch, Lawrence drew me aside, and asked if I was going down to[6475] see him.[6476] [13]
[6477] “No, I don’t think I shall. He can come up here if he wants to see us.”[6478] [13]
[6479] “Oh!” Lawrence looked indeterminate. Something unusually nervous and[6480] excited in his manner roused my curiosity.[6481] [13]
[6482] “What is it?” I asked. “I could go if there’s anything special.”[6483] [13]
[6484] “It’s nothing much, but—well, if you are going, will you tell him——” he[6485] dropped his voice to a whisper—“I think I’ve found the extra[6486] coffee-cup!”[6487] [13]
[6488] I had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of Poirot’s, but now my[6489] curiosity was aroused afresh.[6490] [13]
[6491] Lawrence would say no more, so I decided that I would descend from my[6492] high horse, and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways Cottage.[6493] [13]
[6494] This time I was received with a smile. Monsieur Poirot was within.[6495] Would I mount? I mounted accordingly.[6496] [13]
[6497] Poirot was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands. He[6498] sprang up at my entrance.[6499] [13]
[6500] “What is it?” I asked solicitously. “You are not ill, I trust?”[6501] [13]
[6502] “No, no, not ill. But I decide an affair of great moment.”[6503] [13]
[6504] “Whether to catch the criminal or not?” I asked facetiously.[6505] [13]
[6506] But, to my great surprise, Poirot nodded gravely.[6507] [13]
[6508] “‘To speak or not to speak,’ as your so great Shakespeare says, ‘that[6509] is the question.’”[6510] [13]
[6511] I did not trouble to correct the quotation.[6512] [13]
[6513] “You are not serious, Poirot?”[6514] [13]
[6515] “I am of the most serious. For the most serious of all things hangs in[6516] the balance.”[6517] [13]
[6518] “And that is?”[6519] [13]
[6520] “A woman’s happiness, _mon ami_,” he said gravely.[6521] [13]
[6522] I did not quite know what to say.[6523] [13]
[6524] “The moment has come,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “and I do not know[6525] what to do. For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play. No one[6526] but I, Hercule Poirot, would attempt it!” And he tapped himself proudly[6527] on the breast.[6528] [13]
[6529] After pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his[6530] effect, I gave him Lawrence’s message.[6531] [13]
[6532] “Aha!” he cried. “So he has found the extra coffee-cup. That is good.[6533] He has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced Monsieur[6534] Lawrence of yours!”[6535] [13]
[6536] I did not myself think very highly of Lawrence’s intelligence; but I[6537] forebore to contradict Poirot, and gently took him to task for[6538] forgetting my instructions as to which were Cynthia’s days off.[6539] [13]
[6540] “It is true. I have the head of a sieve. However, the other young lady[6541] was most kind. She was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me[6542] everything in the kindest way.”[6543] [13]
[6544] “Oh, well, that’s all right, then, and you must go to tea with Cynthia[6545] another day.”[6546] [13]
[6547] I told him about the letter.[6548] [13]
[6549] “I am sorry for that,” he said. “I always had hopes of that letter. But[6550] no, it was not to be. This affair must all be unravelled from within.”[6551] He tapped his forehead. “These little grey cells. It is ‘up to them’—as[6552] you say over here.” Then, suddenly, he asked: “Are you a judge of[6553] finger-marks, my friend?”[6554] [13]
[6555] “No,” I said, rather surprised, “I know that there are no two[6556] finger-marks alike, but that’s as far as my science goes.”[6557] [13]
[6558] “Exactly.”[6559] [13]
[6560] He unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which he[6561] laid on the table.[6562] [13]
[6563] “I have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. Will you describe them to me?”[6564] [13]
[6565] I studied the proofs attentively.[6566] [13]
[6567] “All greatly magnified, I see. No. 1, I should say, are a man’s[6568] finger-prints; thumb and first finger. No. 2 are a lady’s; they are[6569] much smaller, and quite different in every way. No. 3”—I paused for[6570] some time—“there seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here,[6571] very distinctly, are No. 1’s.”[6572] [13]
[6573] “Overlapping the others?”[6574] [13]
[6575] “Yes.”[6576] [13]
[6577] “You recognize them beyond fail?”[6578] [13]
[6579] “Oh, yes; they are identical.”[6580] [13]
[6581] Poirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up[6582] again.[6583] [13]
[6584] “I suppose,” I said, “that as usual, you are not going to explain?”[6585] [13]
[6586] “On the contrary. No. 1 were the finger-prints of Monsieur Lawrence.[6587] No. 2 were those of Mademoiselle Cynthia. They are not important. I[6588] merely obtained them for comparison. No. 3 is a little more[6589] complicated.”[6590] [13]
[6591] “Yes?”[6592] [13]
[6593] “It is, as you see, highly magnified. You may have noticed a sort of[6594] blur extending all across the picture. I will not describe to you the[6595] special apparatus, dusting powder, etc., which I used. It is a[6596] well-known process to the police, and by means of it you can obtain a[6597] photograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of[6598] time. Well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marks—it remains to[6599] tell you the particular object on which they had been left.”[6600] [13]
[6601] “Go on—I am really excited.”[6602] [13]
[6603] “_Eh bien!_ Photo No. 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a[6604] tiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the Red[6605] Cross Hospital at Tadminster—which sounds like the house that Jack[6606] built!”[6607] [13]
[6608] “Good heavens!” I exclaimed. “But what were Lawrence Cavendish’s[6609] finger-marks doing on it? He never went near the poison cupboard the[6610] day we were there!”[6611] [13]
[6612] “Oh, yes, he did!”[6613] [13]
[6614] “Impossible! We were all together the whole time.”[6615] [13]
[6616] Poirot shook his head.[6617] [13]
[6618] “No, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together.[6619] There was a moment when you could not have been all together, or it[6620] would not have been necessary to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and[6621] join you on the balcony.”[6622] [13]
[6623] “I’d forgotten that,” I admitted. “But it was only for a moment.”[6624] [13]
[6625] “Long enough.”[6626] [13]
[6627] “Long enough for what?”[6628] [13]
[6629] Poirot’s smile became rather enigmatical.[6630] [13]
[6631] “Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a[6632] very natural interest and curiosity.”[6633] [13]
[6634] Our eyes met. Poirot’s were pleasantly vague. He got up and hummed a[6635] little tune. I watched him suspiciously.[6636] [13]
[6637] “Poirot,” I said, “what was in this particular little bottle?”[6638] [13]
[6639] Poirot looked out of the window.[6640] [13]
[6641] “Hydro-chloride of strychnine,” he said, over his shoulder, continuing[6642] to hum.[6643] [13]
[6644] “Good heavens!” I said it quite quietly. I was not surprised. I had[6645] expected that answer.[6646] [13]
[6647] “They use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little—only[6648] occasionally for pills. It is the official solution, Liq. Strychnine[6649] Hydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. That is why the[6650] finger-marks have remained undisturbed since then.”[6651] [13]
[6652] “How did you manage to take this photograph?”[6653] [13]
[6654] “I dropped my hat from the balcony,” explained Poirot simply. “Visitors[6655] were not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many[6656] apologies, Mademoiselle Cynthia’s colleague had to go down and fetch it[6657] for me.”[6658] [13]
[6659] “Then you knew what you were going to find?”[6660] [13]
[6661] “No, not at all. I merely realized that it was possible, from your[6662] story, for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard. The[6663] possibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated.”[6664] [13]
[6665] “Poirot,” I said, “your gaiety does not deceive me. This is a very[6666] important discovery.”[6667] [13]
[6668] “I do not know,” said Poirot. “But one thing does strike me. No doubt[6669] it has struck you too.”[6670] [13]
[6671] “What is that?”[6672] [13]
[6673] “Why, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case.[6674] This is the third time we run up against it. There was strychnine in[6675] Mrs. Inglethorp’s tonic. There is the strychnine sold across the[6676] counter at Styles St. Mary by Mace. Now we have more strychnine,[6677] handled by one of the household. It is confusing; and, as you know, I[6678] do not like confusion.”[6679] [13]
[6680] Before I could reply, one of the other Belgians opened the door and[6681] stuck his head in.[6682] [13]
[6683] “There is a lady below, asking for Mr Hastings.”[6684] [13]
[6685] “A lady?”[6686] [13]
[6687] I jumped up. Poirot followed me down the narrow stairs. Mary Cavendish[6688] was standing in the doorway.[6689] [13]
[6690] “I have been visiting an old woman in the village,” she explained, “and[6691] as Lawrence told me you were with Monsieur Poirot I thought I would[6692] call for you.”[6693] [13]
[6694] “Alas, madame,” said Poirot, “I thought you had come to honour me with[6695] a visit!”[6696] [13]
[6697] “I will some day, if you ask me,” she promised him, smiling.[6698] [13]
[6699] “That is well. If you should need a father confessor, madame”—she[6700] started ever so slightly—“remember, Papa Poirot is always at your[6701] service.”[6702] [13]
[6703] She stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some[6704] deeper meaning into his words. Then she turned abruptly away.[6705] [13]
[6706] “Come, will you not walk back with us too, Monsieur Poirot?”[6707] [13]
[6708] “Enchanted, madame.”[6709] [13]
[6710] All the way to Styles, Mary talked fast and feverishly. It struck me[6711] that in some way she was nervous of Poirot’s eyes.[6712] [13]
[6713] The weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its[6714] shrewishness. Mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports[6715] coat closer. The wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like[6716] some great giant sighing.[6717] [13]
[6718] We walked up to the great door of Styles, and at once the knowledge[6719] came to us that something was wrong.[6720] [13]
[6721] Dorcas came running out to meet us. She was crying and wringing her[6722] hands. I was aware of other servants huddled together in the[6723] background, all eyes and ears.[6724] [13]
[6725] “Oh, m’am! Oh, m’am! I don’t know how to tell you——”[6726] [13]
[6727] “What is it, Dorcas?” I asked impatiently. “Tell us at once.”[6728] [13]
[6729] “It’s those wicked detectives. They’ve arrested him—they’ve arrested[6730] Mr. Cavendish!”[6731] [13]
[6732] “Arrested Lawrence?” I gasped.[6733] [13]
[6734] I saw a strange look come into Dorcas’s eyes.[6735] [13]
[6736] “No, sir. Not Mr. Lawrence—Mr. John.”[6737] [13]
[6738] Behind me, with a wild cry, Mary Cavendish fell heavily against me, and[6739] as I turned to catch her I met the quiet triumph in Poirot’s eyes.[6740] [13]
[6741] [13]
[6742] [13]
[6743] [13]
[6744] CHAPTER XI.[6745] THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION[6746] [13]
[6747] [13]
[6748] The trial of John Cavendish for the murder of his stepmother took place[6749] two months later.[6750] [13]
[6751] Of the intervening weeks I will say little, but my admiration and[6752] sympathy went out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish. She ranged herself[6753] passionately on her husband’s side, scorning the mere idea of his[6754] guilt, and fought for him tooth and nail.[6755] [13]
[6756] I expressed my admiration to Poirot, and he nodded thoughtfully.[6757] [13]
[6758] “Yes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity. It[6759] brings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. Her pride and her[6760] jealousy have——”[6761] [13]
[6762] “Jealousy?” I queried.[6763] [13]
[6764] “Yes. Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman? As[6765] I was saying, her pride and jealousy have been laid aside. She thinks[6766] of nothing but her husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over[6767] him.”[6768] [13]
[6769] He spoke very feelingly, and I looked at him earnestly, remembering[6770] that last afternoon, when he had been deliberating whether or not to[6771] speak. With his tenderness for “a woman’s happiness,” I felt glad that[6772] the decision had been taken out of his hands.[6773] [13]
[6774] “Even now,” I said, “I can hardly believe it. You see, up to the very[6775] last minute, I thought it was Lawrence!”[6776] [13]
[6777] Poirot grinned.[6778] [13]
[6779] “I know you did.”[6780] [13]
[6781] “But John! My old friend John!”[6782] [13]
[6783] “Every murderer is probably somebody’s old friend,” observed Poirot[6784] philosophically. “You cannot mix up sentiment and reason.”[6785] [13]
[6786] “I must say I think you might have given me a hint.”[6787] [13]
[6788] “Perhaps, _mon ami_, I did not do so, just because he _was_ your old[6789] friend.”[6790] [13]
[6791] I was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how I had busily passed[6792] on to John what I believed to be Poirot’s views concerning Bauerstein.[6793] He, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him.[6794] Nevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and[6795] the charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings[6796] were pretty well clipped for the future.[6797] [13]
[6798] I asked Poirot whether he thought John would be condemned. To my[6799] intense surprise, he replied that, on the contrary, he was extremely[6800] likely to be acquitted.[6801] [13]
[6802] “But, Poirot——” I protested.[6803] [13]
[6804] “Oh, my friend, have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs.[6805] It is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another[6806] matter to prove him so. And, in this case, there is terribly little[6807] evidence. That is the whole trouble. I, Hercule Poirot, know, but I[6808] lack the last link in my chain. And unless I can find that missing[6809] link——” He shook his head gravely.[6810] [13]
[6811] “When did you first suspect John Cavendish?” I asked, after a minute or[6812] two.[6813] [13]
[6814] “Did you not suspect him at all?”[6815] [13]
[6816] “No, indeed.”[6817] [13]
[6818] “Not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs.[6819] Cavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness[6820] at the inquest?”[6821] [13]
[6822] “No.”[6823] [13]
[6824] “Did you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not[6825] Alfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife—and you remember,[6826] he strenuously denied it at the inquest—it must be either Lawrence or[6827] John. Now, if it was Lawrence, Mary Cavendish’s conduct was just as[6828] inexplicable. But if, on the other hand, it was John, the whole thing[6829] was explained quite naturally.”[6830] [13]
[6831] “So,” I cried, a light breaking in upon me, “it was John who quarrelled[6832] with his mother that afternoon?”[6833] [13]
[6834] “Exactly.”[6835] [13]
[6836] “And you have known this all along?”[6837] [13]
[6838] “Certainly. Mrs. Cavendish’s behaviour could only be explained that[6839] way.”[6840] [13]
[6841] “And yet you say he may be acquitted?”[6842] [13]
[6843] Poirot shrugged his shoulders.[6844] [13]
[6845] “Certainly I do. At the police court proceedings, we shall hear the[6846] case for the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will[6847] advise him to reserve his defence. That will be sprung upon us at the[6848] trial. And—ah, by the way, I have a word of caution to give you, my[6849] friend. I must not appear in the case.”[6850] [13]
[6851] “What?”[6852] [13]
[6853] “No. Officially, I have nothing to do with it. Until I have found that[6854] last link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish[6855] must think I am working for her husband, not against him.”[6856] [13]
[6857] “I say, that’s playing it a bit low down,” I protested.[6858] [13]
[6859] “Not at all. We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man,[6860] and we must use any means in our power—otherwise he will slip through[6861] our fingers. That is why I have been careful to remain in the[6862] background. All the discoveries have been made by Japp, and Japp will[6863] take all the credit. If I am called upon to give evidence at all”—he[6864] smiled broadly—“it will probably be as a witness for the defence.”[6865] [13]
[6866] I could hardly believe my ears.[6867] [13]
[6868] “It is quite _en règle_,” continued Poirot. “Strangely enough, I can[6869] give evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution.”[6870] [13]
[6871] “Which one?”[6872] [13]
[6873] “The one that relates to the destruction of the will. John Cavendish[6874] did not destroy that will.”[6875] [13]
[6876] Poirot was a true prophet. I will not go into the details of the police[6877] court proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions. I will[6878] merely state baldly that John Cavendish reserved his defence, and was[6879] duly committed for trial.[6880] [13]
[6881] September found us all in London. Mary took a house in Kensington,[6882] Poirot being included in the family party.[6883] [13]
[6884] I myself had been given a job at the War Office, so was able to see[6885] them continually.[6886] [13]
[6887] As the weeks went by, the state of Poirot’s nerves grew worse and[6888] worse. That “last link” he talked about was still lacking. Privately, I[6889] hoped it might remain so, for what happiness could there be for Mary,[6890] if John were not acquitted?[6891] [13]
[6892] On September 15th John Cavendish appeared in the dock at the Old[6893] Bailey, charged with “The Wilful Murder of Emily Agnes Inglethorp,” and[6894] pleaded “Not Guilty.”[6895] [13]
[6896] Sir Ernest Heavywether, the famous K.C., had been engaged to defend[6897] him.[6898] [13]
[6899] Mr. Philips, K.C., opened the case for the Crown.[6900] [13]
[6901] The murder, he said, was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one. It[6902] was neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and[6903] trusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother.[6904] Ever since his boyhood, she had supported him. He and his wife had[6905] lived at Styles Court in every luxury, surrounded by her care and[6906] attention. She had been their kind and generous benefactress.[6907] [13]
[6908] He proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner, a profligate[6909] and spendthrift, had been at the end of his financial tether, and had[6910] also been carrying on an intrigue with a certain Mrs. Raikes, a[6911] neighbouring farmer’s wife. This having come to his stepmother’s ears,[6912] she taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death, and a quarrel[6913] ensued, part of which was overheard. On the previous day, the prisoner[6914] had purchased strychnine at the village chemist’s shop, wearing a[6915] disguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon[6916] another man—to wit, Mrs. Inglethorp’s husband, of whom he had been[6917] bitterly jealous. Luckily for Mr. Inglethorp, he had been able to[6918] produce an unimpeachable alibi.[6919] [13]
[6920] On the afternoon of July 17th, continued Counsel, immediately after the[6921] quarrel with her son, Mrs. Inglethorp made a new will. This will was[6922] found destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning, but[6923] evidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in[6924] favour of her husband. Deceased had already made a will in his favour[6925] before her marriage, but—and Mr. Philips wagged an expressive[6926] forefinger—the prisoner was not aware of that. What had induced the[6927] deceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he could[6928] not say. She was an old lady, and might possibly have forgotten the[6929] former one; or—this seemed to him more likely—she may have had an idea[6930] that it was revoked by her marriage, as there had been some[6931] conversation on the subject. Ladies were not always very well versed in[6932] legal knowledge. She had, about a year before, executed a will in[6933] favour of the prisoner. He would call evidence to show that it was the[6934] prisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal[6935] night. Later in the evening, he had sought admission to her room, on[6936] which occasion, no doubt, he found an opportunity of destroying the[6937] will which, as far as he knew, would render the one in his favour[6938] valid.[6939] [13]
[6940] The prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his[6941] room, by Detective Inspector Japp—a most brilliant officer—of the[6942] identical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village[6943] chemist’s to the supposed Mr. Inglethorp on the day before the murder.[6944] It would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts[6945] constituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner’s guilt.[6946] [13]
[6947] And, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite[6948] unthinkable, Mr. Philips sat down and wiped his forehead.[6949] [13]
[6950] The first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been[6951] called at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first.[6952] [13]
[6953] Sir Ernest Heavywether, who was famous all over England for the[6954] unscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two[6955] questions.[6956] [13]
[6957] “I take it, Dr. Bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?”[6958] [13]
[6959] “Yes.”[6960] [13]
[6961] “And that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?”[6962] [13]
[6963] “Yes.”[6964] [13]
[6965] “Thank you.”[6966] [13]
[6967] Mr. Mace identified the phial handed him by Counsel as that sold by him[6968] to “Mr. Inglethorp.” Pressed, he admitted that he only knew Mr.[6969] Inglethorp by sight. He had never spoken to him. The witness was not[6970] cross-examined.[6971] [13]
[6972] Alfred Inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison.[6973] He also denied having quarrelled with his wife. Various witnesses[6974] testified to the accuracy of these statements.[6975] [13]
[6976] The gardeners’ evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken,[6977] and then Dorcas was called.[6978] [13]
[6979] Dorcas, faithful to her “young gentlemen,” denied strenuously that it[6980] could have been John’s voice she heard, and resolutely declared, in the[6981] teeth of everything, that it was Mr. Inglethorp who had been in the[6982] boudoir with her mistress. A rather wistful smile passed across the[6983] face of the prisoner in the dock. He knew only too well how useless her[6984] gallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to[6985] deny this point. Mrs. Cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to[6986] give evidence against her husband.[6987] [13]
[6988] After various questions on other matters, Mr. Philips asked:[6989] [13]
[6990] “In the month of June last, do you remember a parcel arriving for Mr.[6991] Lawrence Cavendish from Parkson’s?”[6992] [13]
[6993] Dorcas shook her head.[6994] [13]
[6995] “I don’t remember, sir. It may have done, but Mr. Lawrence was away[6996] from home part of June.”[6997] [13]
[6998] “In the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away, what[6999] would be done with it?”[7000] [13]
[7001] “It would either be put in his room or sent on after him.”[7002] [13]
[7003] “By you?”[7004] [13]
[7005] “No, sir, I should leave it on the hall table. It would be Miss Howard[7006] who would attend to anything like that.”[7007] [13]
[7008] Evelyn Howard was called and, after being examined on other points, was[7009] questioned as to the parcel.[7010] [13]
[7011] “Don’t remember. Lots of parcels come. Can’t remember one special one.”[7012] [13]
[7013] “You do not know if it was sent after Mr. Lawrence Cavendish to Wales,[7014] or whether it was put in his room?”[7015] [13]
[7016] “Don’t think it was sent after him. Should have remembered it if it[7017] was.”[7018] [13]
[7019] “Supposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and[7020] afterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence?”[7021] [13]
[7022] “No, don’t think so. I should think someone had taken charge of it.”[7023] [13]
[7024] “I believe, Miss Howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown[7025] paper?” He held up the same dusty piece which Poirot and I had examined[7026] in the morning-room at Styles.[7027] [13]
[7028] “Yes, I did.”[7029] [13]
[7030] “How did you come to look for it?”[7031] [13]
[7032] “The Belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search[7033] for it.”[7034] [13]
[7035] “Where did you eventually discover it?”[7036] [13]
[7037] “On the top of—of—a wardrobe.”[7038] [13]
[7039] “On top of the prisoner’s wardrobe?”[7040] [13]
[7041] “I—I believe so.”[7042] [13]
[7043] “Did you not find it yourself?”[7044] [13]
[7045] “Yes.”[7046] [13]
[7047] “Then you must know where you found it?”[7048] [13]
[7049] “Yes, it was on the prisoner’s wardrobe.”[7050] [13]
[7051] “That is better.”[7052] [13]
[7053] An assistant from Parkson’s, Theatrical Costumiers, testified that on[7054] June 29th, they had supplied a black beard to Mr. L. Cavendish, as[7055] requested. It was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed.[7056] No, they had not kept the letter. All transactions were entered in[7057] their books. They had sent the beard, as directed, to “L. Cavendish,[7058] Esq., Styles Court.”[7059] [13]
[7060] Sir Ernest Heavywether rose ponderously.[7061] [13]
[7062] “Where was the letter written from?”[7063] [13]
[7064] “From Styles Court.”[7065] [13]
[7066] “The same address to which you sent the parcel?”[7067] [13]
[7068] “Yes.”[7069] [13]
[7070] “And the letter came from there?”[7071] [13]
[7072] “Yes.”[7073] [13]
[7074] Like a beast of prey, Heavywether fell upon him:[7075] [13]
[7076] “How do you know?”[7077] [13]
[7078] “I—I don’t understand.”[7079] [13]
[7080] “How do you know that letter came from Styles? Did you notice the[7081] postmark?”[7082] [13]
[7083] “No—but——”[7084] [13]
[7085] “Ah, you did _not_ notice the postmark! And yet you affirm so[7086] confidently that it came from Styles. It might, in fact, have been any[7087] postmark?”[7088] [13]
[7089] “Y—es.”[7090] [13]
[7091] “In fact, the letter, though written on stamped notepaper, might have[7092] been posted from anywhere? From Wales, for instance?”[7093] [13]
[7094] The witness admitted that such might be the case, and Sir Ernest[7095] signified that he was satisfied.[7096] [13]
[7097] Elizabeth Wells, second housemaid at Styles, stated that after she had[7098] gone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door, instead[7099] of leaving it on the latch as Mr. Inglethorp had requested. She had[7100] accordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error. Hearing a[7101] slight noise in the West wing, she had peeped along the passage, and[7102] had seen Mr. John Cavendish knocking at Mrs. Inglethorp’s door.[7103] [13]
[7104] Sir Ernest Heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful[7105] bullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and Sir Ernest sat down[7106] again with a satisfied smile on his face.[7107] [13]
[7108] With the evidence of Annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and[7109] as to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the[7110] proceedings were adjourned until the following day.[7111] [13]
[7112] As we went home, Mary Cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting[7113] counsel.[7114] [13]
[7115] “That hateful man! What a net he has drawn around my poor John! How he[7116] twisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn’t!”[7117] [13]
[7118] “Well,” I said consolingly, “it will be the other way about to-morrow.”[7119] [13]
[7120] “Yes,” she said meditatively; then suddenly dropped her voice. “Mr.[7121] Hastings, you do not think—surely it could not have been Lawrence—Oh,[7122] no, that could not be!”[7123] [13]
[7124] But I myself was puzzled, and as soon as I was alone with Poirot I[7125] asked him what he thought Sir Ernest was driving at.[7126] [13]
[7127] “Ah!” said Poirot appreciatively. “He is a clever man, that Sir[7128] Ernest.”[7129] [13]
[7130] “Do you think he believes Lawrence guilty?”[7131] [13]
[7132] “I do not think he believes or cares anything! No, what he is trying[7133] for is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are[7134] divided in their opinion as to which brother did it. He is endeavouring[7135] to make out that there is quite as much evidence against Lawrence as[7136] against John—and I am not at all sure that he will not succeed.”[7137] [13]
[7138] Detective-inspector Japp was the first witness called when the trial[7139] was reopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly. After[7140] relating the earlier events, he proceeded:[7141] [13]
[7142] “Acting on information received, Superintendent Summerhaye and myself[7143] searched the prisoner’s room, during his temporary absence from the[7144] house. In his chest of drawers, hidden beneath some underclothing, we[7145] found: first, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by[7146] Mr. Inglethorp”—these were exhibited—“secondly, this phial.”[7147] [13]
[7148] The phial was that already recognized by the chemist’s assistant, a[7149] tiny bottle of blue glass, containing a few grains of a white[7150] crystalline powder, and labelled: “Strychnine Hydro-chloride. POISON.”[7151] [13]
[7152] A fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police[7153] court proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. It[7154] had been found in Mrs. Inglethorp’s cheque book, and on being reversed[7155] at a mirror, showed clearly the words: “. . . erything of which I die[7156] possessed I leave to my beloved husband Alfred Ing...” This placed[7157] beyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of[7158] the deceased lady’s husband. Japp then produced the charred fragment of[7159] paper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the[7160] beard in the attic, completed his evidence.[7161] [13]
[7162] But Sir Ernest’s cross-examination was yet to come.[7163] [13]
[7164] “What day was it when you searched the prisoner’s room?”[7165] [13]
[7166] “Tuesday, the 24th of July.”[7167] [13]
[7168] “Exactly a week after the tragedy?”[7169] [13]
[7170] “Yes.”[7171] [13]
[7172] “You found these two objects, you say, in the chest of drawers. Was the[7173] drawer unlocked?”[7174] [13]
[7175] “Yes.”[7176] [13]
[7177] “Does it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a[7178] crime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone[7179] to find?”[7180] [13]
[7181] “He might have stowed them there in a hurry.”[7182] [13]
[7183] “But you have just said it was a whole week since the crime. He would[7184] have had ample time to remove them and destroy them.”[7185] [13]
[7186] “Perhaps.”[7187] [13]
[7188] “There is no perhaps about it. Would he, or would he not have had[7189] plenty of time to remove and destroy them?”[7190] [13]
[7191] “Yes.”[7192] [13]
[7193] “Was the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy[7194] or light?”[7195] [13]
[7196] “Heavyish.”[7197] [13]
[7198] “In other words, it was winter underclothing. Obviously, the prisoner[7199] would not be likely to go to that drawer?”[7200] [13]
[7201] “Perhaps not.”[7202] [13]
[7203] “Kindly answer my question. Would the prisoner, in the hottest week of[7204] a hot summer, be likely to go to a drawer containing winter[7205] underclothing. Yes, or no?”[7206] [13]
[7207] “No.”[7208] [13]
[7209] “In that case, is it not possible that the articles in question might[7210] have been put there by a third person, and that the prisoner was quite[7211] unaware of their presence?”[7212] [13]
[7213] “I should not think it likely.”[7214] [13]
[7215] “But it is possible?”[7216] [13]
[7217] “Yes.”[7218] [13]
[7219] “That is all.”[7220] [13]
[7221] More evidence followed. Evidence as to the financial difficulties in[7222] which the prisoner had found himself at the end of July. Evidence as to[7223] his intrigue with Mrs. Raikes—poor Mary, that must have been bitter[7224] hearing for a woman of her pride. Evelyn Howard had been right in her[7225] facts, though her animosity against Alfred Inglethorp had caused her to[7226] jump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned.[7227] [13]
[7228] Lawrence Cavendish was then put into the box. In a low voice, in answer[7229] to Mr. Philips’ questions, he denied having ordered anything from[7230] Parkson’s in June. In fact, on June 29th, he had been staying away, in[7231] Wales.[7232] [13]
[7233] Instantly, Sir Ernest’s chin was shooting pugnaciously forward.[7234] [13]
[7235] “You deny having ordered a black beard from Parkson’s on June 29th?”[7236] [13]
[7237] “I do.”[7238] [13]
[7239] “Ah! In the event of anything happening to your brother, who will[7240] inherit Styles Court?”[7241] [13]
[7242] The brutality of the question called a flush to Lawrence’s pale face.[7243] The judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the[7244] prisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.[7245] [13]
[7246] Heavywether cared nothing for his client’s anger.[7247] [13]
[7248] “Answer my question, if you please.”[7249] [13]
[7250] “I suppose,” said Lawrence quietly, “that I should.”[7251] [13]
[7252] “What do you mean by you ‘suppose’? Your brother has no children. You[7253] _would_ inherit it, wouldn’t you?”[7254] [13]
[7255] “Yes.”[7256] [13]
[7257] “Ah, that’s better,” said Heavywether, with ferocious geniality. “And[7258] you’d inherit a good slice of money too, wouldn’t you?”[7259] [13]
[7260] “Really, Sir Ernest,” protested the judge, “these questions are not[7261] relevant.”[7262] [13]
[7263] Sir Ernest bowed, and having shot his arrow proceeded.[7264] [13]
[7265] “On Tuesday, the 17th July, you went, I believe, with another guest, to[7266] visit the dispensary at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster?”[7267] [13]
[7268] “Yes.”[7269] [13]
[7270] “Did you—while you happened to be alone for a few seconds—unlock the[7271] poison cupboard, and examine some of the bottles?”[7272] [13]
[7273] “I—I—may have done so.”[7274] [13]
[7275] “I put it to you that you did do so?”[7276] [13]
[7277] “Yes.”[7278] [13]
[7279] Sir Ernest fairly shot the next question at him.[7280] [13]
[7281] “Did you examine one bottle in particular?”[7282] [13]
[7283] “No, I do not think so.”[7284] [13]
[7285] “Be careful, Mr. Cavendish. I am referring to a little bottle of[7286] Hydro-chloride of Strychnine.”[7287] [13]
[7288] Lawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour.[7289] [13]
[7290] “N—o—I am sure I didn’t.”[7291] [13]
[7292] “Then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable[7293] impress of your finger-prints on it?”[7294] [13]
[7295] The bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition.[7296] [13]
[7297] “I—I suppose I must have taken up the bottle.”[7298] [13]
[7299] “I suppose so too! Did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle?”[7300] [13]
[7301] “Certainly not.”[7302] [13]
[7303] “Then why did you take it up?”[7304] [13]
[7305] “I once studied to be a doctor. Such things naturally interest me.”[7306] [13]
[7307] “Ah! So poisons ‘naturally interest’ you, do they? Still, you waited to[7308] be alone before gratifying that ‘interest’ of yours?”[7309] [13]
[7310] “That was pure chance. If the others had been there, I should have done[7311] just the same.”[7312] [13]
[7313] “Still, as it happens, the others were not there?”[7314] [13]
[7315] “No, but——”[7316] [13]
[7317] “In fact, during the whole afternoon, you were only alone for a couple[7318] of minutes, and it happened—I say, it happened—to be during those two[7319] minutes that you displayed your ‘natural interest’ in Hydro-chloride of[7320] Strychnine?”[7321] [13]
[7322] Lawrence stammered pitiably.[7323] [13]
[7324] “I—I——”[7325] [13]
[7326] With a satisfied and expressive countenance, Sir Ernest observed:[7327] [13]
[7328] “I have nothing more to ask you, Mr. Cavendish.”[7329] [13]
[7330] This bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court. The[7331] heads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid[7332] together, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily[7333] threatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate[7334] silence.[7335] [13]
[7336] There was little more evidence. The hand-writing experts were called[7337] upon for their opinion of the signature of “Alfred Inglethorp” in the[7338] chemist’s poison register. They all declared unanimously that it was[7339] certainly not his hand-writing, and gave it as their view that it might[7340] be that of the prisoner disguised. Cross-examined, they admitted that[7341] it might be the prisoner’s hand-writing cleverly counterfeited.[7342] [13]
[7343] Sir Ernest Heavywether’s speech in opening the case for the defence was[7344] not a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic[7345] manner. Never, he said, in the course of his long experience, had he[7346] known a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence. Not only was it[7347] entirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically[7348] unproved. Let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it[7349] impartially. The strychnine had been found in a drawer in the[7350] prisoner’s room. That drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed[7351] out, and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was[7352] the prisoner who had concealed the poison there. It was, in fact, a[7353] wicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix[7354] the crime on the prisoner. The prosecution had been unable to produce a[7355] shred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the[7356] prisoner who ordered the black beard from Parkson’s. The quarrel which[7357] had taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely[7358] admitted, but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly[7359] exaggerated.[7360] [13]
[7361] His learned friend—Sir Ernest nodded carelessly at Mr. Philips—had[7362] stated that if the prisoner were an innocent man, he would have come[7363] forward at the inquest to explain that it was he, and not Mr.[7364] Inglethorp, who had been the participator in the quarrel. He thought[7365] the facts had been misrepresented. What had actually occurred was this.[7366] The prisoner, returning to the house on Tuesday evening, had been[7367] authoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between Mr.[7368] and Mrs. Inglethorp. No suspicion had entered the prisoner’s head that[7369] anyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of Mr.[7370] Inglethorp. He naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two[7371] quarrels.[7372] [13]
[7373] The prosecution averred that on Monday, July 16th, the prisoner had[7374] entered the chemist’s shop in the village, disguised as Mr. Inglethorp.[7375] The prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called[7376] Marston’s Spinney, where he had been summoned by an anonymous note,[7377] couched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain[7378] matters to his wife unless he complied with its demands. The prisoner[7379] had, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there[7380] vainly for half an hour had returned home. Unfortunately, he had met[7381] with no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of[7382] his story, but luckily he had kept the note, and it would be produced[7383] as evidence.[7384] [13]
[7385] As for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the[7386] prisoner had formerly practised at the Bar, and was perfectly well[7387] aware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically[7388] revoked by his stepmother’s remarriage. He would call evidence to show[7389] who did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up[7390] quite a new view of the case.[7391] [13]
[7392] Finally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against[7393] other people besides John Cavendish. He would direct their attention to[7394] the fact that the evidence against Mr. Lawrence Cavendish was quite as[7395] strong, if not stronger than that against his brother.[7396] [13]
[7397] He would now call the prisoner.[7398] [13]
[7399] John acquitted himself well in the witness-box. Under Sir Ernest’s[7400] skilful handling, he told his tale credibly and well. The anonymous[7401] note received by him was produced, and handed to the jury to examine.[7402] The readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties, and[7403] the disagreement with his stepmother, lent value to his denials.[7404] [13]
[7405] At the close of his examination, he paused, and said:[7406] [13]
[7407] “I should like to make one thing clear. I utterly reject and disapprove[7408] of Sir Ernest Heavywether’s insinuations against my brother. My[7409] brother, I am convinced, had no more to do with the crime than I have.”[7410] [13]
[7411] Sir Ernest merely smiled, and noted with a sharp eye that John’s[7412] protest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury.[7413] [13]
[7414] Then the cross-examination began.[7415] [13]
[7416] “I understand you to say that it never entered your head that the[7417] witnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for[7418] that of Mr. Inglethorp. Is not that very surprising?”[7419] [13]
[7420] “No, I don’t think so. I was told there had been a quarrel between my[7421] mother and Mr. Inglethorp, and it never occurred to me that such was[7422] not really the case.”[7423] [13]
[7424] “Not when the servant Dorcas repeated certain fragments of the[7425] conversation—fragments which you must have recognized?”[7426] [13]
[7427] “I did not recognize them.”[7428] [13]
[7429] “Your memory must be unusually short!”[7430] [13]
[7431] “No, but we were both angry, and, I think, said more than we meant. I[7432] paid very little attention to my mother’s actual words.”[7433] [13]
[7434] Mr. Philips’ incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill. He[7435] passed on to the subject of the note.[7436] [13]
[7437] “You have produced this note very opportunely. Tell me, is there[7438] nothing familiar about the hand-writing of it?”[7439] [13]
[7440] “Not that I know of.”[7441] [13]
[7442] “Do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own[7443] hand-writing—carelessly disguised?”[7444] [13]
[7445] “No, I do not think so.”[7446] [13]
[7447] “I put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!”[7448] [13]
[7449] “No.”[7450] [13]
[7451] “I put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the[7452] idea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this[7453] note yourself in order to bear out your statement!”[7454] [13]
[7455] “No.”[7456] [13]
[7457] “Is it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waiting[7458] about at a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in the[7459] chemist’s shop in Styles St. Mary, where you purchased strychnine in[7460] the name of Alfred Inglethorp?”[7461] [13]
[7462] “No, that is a lie.”[7463] [13]
[7464] “I put it to you that, wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorp’s clothes, with[7465] a black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were there—and signed the[7466] register in his name!”[7467] [13]
[7468] “That is absolutely untrue.”[7469] [13]
[7470] “Then I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between[7471] the note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of the[7472] jury,” said Mr. Philips, and sat down with the air of a man who has[7473] done his duty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate[7474] perjury.[7475] [13]
[7476] After this, as it was growing late, the case was adjourned till Monday.[7477] [13]
[7478] Poirot, I noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged. He had that[7479] little frown between the eyes that I knew so well.[7480] [13]
[7481] “What is it, Poirot?” I inquired.[7482] [13]
[7483] “Ah, _mon ami_, things are going badly, badly.”[7484] [13]
[7485] In spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief. Evidently there was[7486] a likelihood of John Cavendish being acquitted.[7487] [13]
[7488] When we reached the house, my little friend waved aside Mary’s offer of[7489] tea.[7490] [13]
[7491] “No, I thank you, madame. I will mount to my room.”[7492] [13]
[7493] I followed him. Still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out[7494] a small pack of patience cards. Then he drew up a chair to the table,[7495] and, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses![7496] [13]
[7497] My jaw dropped involuntarily, and he said at once:[7498] [13]
[7499] “No, _mon ami_, I am not in my second childhood! I steady my nerves,[7500] that is all. This employment requires precision of the fingers. With[7501] precision of the fingers goes precision of the brain. And never have I[7502] needed that more than now!”[7503] [13]
[7504] “What is the trouble?” I asked.[7505] [13]
[7506] With a great thump on the table, Poirot demolished his carefully built[7507] up edifice.[7508] [13]
[7509] “It is this, _mon ami!_ That I can build card houses seven stories[7510] high, but I cannot”—thump—“find”—thump—“ that last link of which I[7511] spoke to you.”[7512] [13]
[7513] I could not quite tell what to say, so I held my peace, and he began[7514] slowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he did so.[7515] [13]
[7516] “It is done—so! By placing—one card—on another—with[7517] mathematical—precision!”[7518] [13]
[7519] I watched the card house rising under his hands, story by story. He[7520] never hesitated or faltered. It was really almost like a conjuring[7521] trick.[7522] [13]
[7523] “What a steady hand you’ve got,” I remarked. “I believe I’ve only seen[7524] your hand shake once.”[7525] [13]
[7526] “On an occasion when I was enraged, without doubt,” observed Poirot,[7527] with great placidity.[7528] [13]
[7529] “Yes indeed! You were in a towering rage. Do you remember? It was when[7530] you discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorp’s[7531] bedroom had been forced. You stood by the mantelpiece, twiddling the[7532] things on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! I[7533] must say——”[7534] [13]
[7535] But I stopped suddenly. For Poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate[7536] cry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands[7537] over his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the[7538] keenest agony.[7539] [13]
[7540] “Good heavens, Poirot!” I cried. “What is the matter? Are you taken[7541] ill?”[7542] [13]
[7543] “No, no,” he gasped. “It is—it is—that I have an idea!”[7544] [13]
[7545] “Oh!” I exclaimed, much relieved. “One of your ‘little ideas’?”[7546] [13]
[7547] “Ah, _ma foi_, no!” replied Poirot frankly. “This time it is an idea[7548] gigantic! Stupendous! And you—_you_, my friend, have given it to me!”[7549] [13]
[7550] Suddenly clasping me in his arms, he kissed me warmly on both cheeks,[7551] and before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room.[7552] [13]
[7553] Mary Cavendish entered at that moment.[7554] [13]
[7555] “What _is_ the matter with Monsieur Poirot? He rushed past me crying[7556] out: ‘A garage! For the love of Heaven, direct me to a garage, madame!’[7557] And, before I could answer, he had dashed out into the street.”[7558] [13]
[7559] I hurried to the window. True enough, there he was, tearing down the[7560] street, hatless, and gesticulating as he went. I turned to Mary with a[7561] gesture of despair.[7562] [13]
[7563] “He’ll be stopped by a policeman in another minute. There he goes,[7564] round the corner!”[7565] [13]
[7566] Our eyes met, and we stared helplessly at one another.[7567] [13]
[7568] “What can be the matter?”[7569] [13]
[7570] I shook my head.[7571] [13]
[7572] “I don’t know. He was building card houses, when suddenly he said he[7573] had an idea, and rushed off as you saw.”[7574] [13]
[7575] “Well,” said Mary, “I expect he will be back before dinner.”[7576] [13]
[7577] But night fell, and Poirot had not returned.[7578] [13]
[7579] [13]
[7580] [13]
[7581] [13]
[7582] CHAPTER XII.[7583] THE LAST LINK[7584] [13]
[7585] [13]
[7586] Poirot’s abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly. Sunday morning[7587] wore away, and still he did not reappear. But about three o’clock a[7588] ferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window, to see[7589] Poirot alighting from a car, accompanied by Japp and Summerhaye. The[7590] little man was transformed. He radiated an absurd complacency. He bowed[7591] with exaggerated respect to Mary Cavendish.[7592] [13]
[7593] “Madame, I have your permission to hold a little _réunion_ in the[7594] _salon_? It is necessary for everyone to attend.”[7595] [13]
[7596] Mary smiled sadly.[7597] [13]
[7598] “You know, Monsieur Poirot, that you have _carte blanche_ in every[7599] way.”[7600] [13]
[7601] “You are too amiable, madame.”[7602] [13]
[7603] Still beaming, Poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room, bringing[7604] forward chairs as he did so.[7605] [13]
[7606] “Miss Howard—here. Mademoiselle Cynthia. Monsieur Lawrence. The good[7607] Dorcas. And Annie. _Bien!_ We must delay our proceedings a few minutes[7608] until Mr. Inglethorp arrives. I have sent him a note.”[7609] [13]
[7610] Miss Howard rose immediately from her seat.[7611] [13]
[7612] “If that man comes into the house, I leave it!”[7613] [13]
[7614] “No, no!” Poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice.[7615] [13]
[7616] Finally Miss Howard consented to return to her chair. A few minutes[7617] later Alfred Inglethorp entered the room.[7618] [13]
[7619] The company once assembled, Poirot rose from his seat with the air of a[7620] popular lecturer, and bowed politely to his audience.[7621] [13]
[7622] “_Messieurs, mesdames_, as you all know, I was called in by Monsieur[7623] John Cavendish to investigate this case. I at once examined the bedroom[7624] of the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept[7625] locked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy[7626] occurred. I found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain[7627] on the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of[7628] bromide powders.[7629] [13]
[7630] “To take the fragment of green material first, I found it caught in the[7631] bolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one[7632] occupied by Mademoiselle Cynthia. I handed the fragment over to the[7633] police who did not consider it of much importance. Nor did they[7634] recognize it for what it was—a piece torn from a green land armlet.”[7635] [13]
[7636] There was a little stir of excitement.[7637] [13]
[7638] “Now there was only one person at Styles who worked on the land—Mrs.[7639] Cavendish. Therefore it must have been Mrs. Cavendish who entered the[7640] deceased’s room through the door communicating with Mademoiselle[7641] Cynthia’s room.”[7642] [13]
[7643] “But that door was bolted on the inside!” I cried.[7644] [13]
[7645] “When I examined the room, yes. But in the first place we have only her[7646] word for it, since it was she who tried that particular door and[7647] reported it fastened. In the ensuing confusion she would have had ample[7648] opportunity to shoot the bolt across. I took an early opportunity of[7649] verifying my conjectures. To begin with, the fragment corresponds[7650] exactly with a tear in Mrs. Cavendish’s armlet. Also, at the inquest,[7651] Mrs. Cavendish declared that she had heard, from her own room, the fall[7652] of the table by the bed. I took an early opportunity of testing that[7653] statement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of[7654] the building, just outside Mrs. Cavendish’s door. I myself, in company[7655] with the police, went to the deceased’s room, and whilst there I,[7656] apparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found[7657] that, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all.[7658] This confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth[7659] when she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of[7660] the tragedy. In fact, I was convinced that, far from having been in her[7661] own room, Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceased’s room when the[7662] alarm was given.”[7663] [13]
[7664] I shot a quick glance at Mary. She was very pale, but smiling.[7665] [13]
[7666] “I proceeded to reason on that assumption. Mrs. Cavendish is in her[7667] mother-in-law’s room. We will say that she is seeking for something and[7668] has not yet found it. Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized[7669] with an alarming paroxysm. She flings out her arm, overturning the bed[7670] table, and then pulls desperately at the bell. Mrs. Cavendish,[7671] startled, drops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet. She[7672] picks it up, and retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia’s room,[7673] closing the door behind her. She hurries out into the passage, for the[7674] servants must not find her where she is. But it is too late! Already[7675] footsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings.[7676] What can she do? Quick as thought, she hurries back to the young girl’s[7677] room, and starts shaking her awake. The hastily aroused household come[7678] trooping down the passage. They are all busily battering at Mrs.[7679] Inglethorp’s door. It occurs to nobody that Mrs. Cavendish has not[7680] arrived with the rest, but—and this is significant—I can find no one[7681] who saw her come from the other wing.” He looked at Mary Cavendish. “Am[7682] I right, madame?”[7683] [13]
[7684] She bowed her head.[7685] [13]
[7686] “Quite right, monsieur. You understand that, if I had thought I would[7687] do my husband any good by revealing these facts, I would have done so.[7688] But it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or[7689] innocence.”[7690] [13]
[7691] “In a sense, that is correct, madame. But it cleared my mind of many[7692] misconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true[7693] significance.”[7694] [13]
[7695] “The will!” cried Lawrence. “Then it was you, Mary, who destroyed the[7696] will?”[7697] [13]
[7698] She shook her head, and Poirot shook his also.[7699] [13]
[7700] “No,” he said quietly. “There is only one person who could possibly[7701] have destroyed that will—Mrs. Inglethorp herself!”[7702] [13]
[7703] “Impossible!” I exclaimed. “She had only made it out that very[7704] afternoon!”[7705] [13]
[7706] “Nevertheless, _mon ami_, it was Mrs. Inglethorp. Because, in no other[7707] way can you account for the fact that, on one of the hottest days of[7708] the year, Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room.”[7709] [13]
[7710] I gave a gasp. What idiots we had been never to think of that fire as[7711] being incongruous! Poirot was continuing:[7712] [13]
[7713] “The temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade.[7714] Yet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire! Why? Because she wished to destroy[7715] something, and could think of no other way. You will remember that, in[7716] consequence of the War economics practiced at Styles, no waste paper[7717] was thrown away. There was therefore no means of destroying a thick[7718] document such as a will. The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in[7719] Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, I leaped to the conclusion that it was to[7720] destroy some important document—possibly a will. So the discovery of[7721] the charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. I did not, of[7722] course, know at the time that the will in question had only been made[7723] this afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell[7724] into a grievous error. I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp’s[7725] determination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the[7726] quarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took[7727] place after, and not before the making of the will.[7728] [13]
[7729] “Here, as we know, I was wrong, and I was forced to abandon that idea.[7730] I faced the problem from a new standpoint. Now, at four o’clock, Dorcas[7731] overheard her mistress saying angrily: ‘You need not think that any[7732] fear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.”[7733] I conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were[7734] addressed, not to her husband, but to Mr. John Cavendish. At five[7735] o’clock, an hour later, she uses almost the same words, but the[7736] standpoint is different. She admits to Dorcas, ‘I don’t know what to[7737] do; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing.’ At four[7738] o’clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. At five[7739] o’clock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great[7740] shock.[7741] [13]
[7742] “Looking at the matter psychologically, I drew one deduction which I[7743] was convinced was correct. The second ‘scandal’ she spoke of was not[7744] the same as the first—and it concerned herself![7745] [13]
[7746] “Let us reconstruct. At four o’clock, Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with her[7747] son, and threatens to denounce him to his wife—who, by the way,[7748] overheard the greater part of the conversation. At four-thirty, Mrs.[7749] Inglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills,[7750] makes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness.[7751] At five o’clock, Dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable[7752] agitation, with a slip of paper—‘a letter,’ Dorcas thinks—in her hand,[7753] and it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted.[7754] Presumably, then, between four-thirty and five o’clock, something has[7755] occurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now[7756] as anxious to destroy the will, as she was before to make it. What was[7757] that something?[7758] [13]
[7759] “As far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. Nobody[7760] entered or left that boudoir. What then occasioned this sudden change[7761] of sentiment?[7762] [13]
[7763] “One can only guess, but I believe my guess to be correct. Mrs.[7764] Inglethorp had no stamps in her desk. We know this, because later she[7765] asked Dorcas to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room[7766] stood her husband’s desk—locked. She was anxious to find some stamps,[7767] and, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk. That[7768] one of them fitted I know. She therefore opened the desk, and in[7769] searching for the stamps she came across something else—that slip of[7770] paper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant[7771] for Mrs. Inglethorp’s eyes. On the other hand, Mrs. Cavendish believed[7772] that the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously[7773] was a written proof of her own husband’s infidelity. She demanded it[7774] from Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing[7775] to do with that matter. Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her. She thought[7776] that Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson. Now Mrs. Cavendish is a[7777] very resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly[7778] jealous of her husband. She determined to get hold of that paper at all[7779] costs, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. She happened to[7780] pick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp’s despatch-case, which had been lost[7781] that morning. She knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all[7782] important papers in this particular case.[7783] [13]
[7784] “Mrs. Cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven[7785] desperate through jealousy could have done. Some time in the evening[7786] she unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia’s room.[7787] Possibly she applied oil to the hinges, for I found that it opened[7788] quite noiselessly when I tried it. She put off her project until the[7789] early hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were[7790] accustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time. She dressed[7791] completely in her land kit, and made her way quietly through[7792] Mademoiselle Cynthia’s room into that of Mrs. Inglethorp.”[7793] [13]
[7794] He paused a moment, and Cynthia interrupted:[7795] [13]
[7796] “But I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room?”[7797] [13]
[7798] “Not if you were drugged, mademoiselle.”[7799] [13]
[7800] “Drugged?”[7801] [13]
[7802] “_Mais, oui!_”[7803] [13]
[7804] “You remember”—he addressed us collectively again—“that through all the[7805] tumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia slept. That admitted of[7806] two possibilities. Either her sleep was feigned—which I did not[7807] believe—or her unconsciousness was induced by artificial means.[7808] [13]
[7809] “With this latter idea in my mind, I examined all the coffee-cups most[7810] carefully, remembering that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had brought[7811] Mademoiselle Cynthia her coffee the night before. I took a sample from[7812] each cup, and had them analysed—with no result. I had counted the cups[7813] carefully, in the event of one having been removed. Six persons had[7814] taken coffee, and six cups were duly found. I had to confess myself[7815] mistaken.[7816] [13]
[7817] “Then I discovered that I had been guilty of a very grave oversight.[7818] Coffee had been brought in for seven persons, not six, for Dr.[7819] Bauerstein had been there that evening. This changed the face of the[7820] whole affair, for there was now one cup missing. The servants noticed[7821] nothing, since Annie, the housemaid, who took in the coffee, brought in[7822] seven cups, not knowing that Mr. Inglethorp never drank it, whereas[7823] Dorcas, who cleared them away the following morning, found six as[7824] usual—or strictly speaking she found five, the sixth being the one[7825] found broken in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room.[7826] [13]
[7827] “I was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia.[7828] I had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the[7829] cups found contained sugar, which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in[7830] her coffee. My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some[7831] ‘salt’ on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to Mrs.[7832] Inglethorp’s room. I accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and[7833] sent it to be analysed.”[7834] [13]
[7835] “But that had already been done by Dr. Bauerstein,” said Lawrence[7836] quickly.[7837] [13]
[7838] “Not exactly. The analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine[7839] was, or was not, present. He did not have it tested, as I did, for a[7840] narcotic.”[7841] [13]
[7842] “For a narcotic?”[7843] [13]
[7844] “Yes. Here is the analyst’s report. Mrs. Cavendish administered a safe,[7845] but effectual, narcotic to both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle[7846] Cynthia. And it is possible that she had a _mauvais quart d’heure_ in[7847] consequence! Imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly[7848] taken ill and dies, and immediately after she hears the word ‘Poison’![7849] She has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was[7850] perfectly harmless, but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment[7851] she must have feared that Mrs. Inglethorp’s death lay at her door. She[7852] is seized with panic, and under its influence she hurries downstairs,[7853] and quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by Mademoiselle[7854] Cynthia into a large brass vase, where it is discovered later by[7855] Monsieur Lawrence. The remains of the cocoa she dare not touch. Too[7856] many eyes are upon her. Guess at her relief when strychnine is[7857] mentioned, and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her[7858] doing.[7859] [13]
[7860] “We are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning[7861] being so long in making their appearance. A narcotic taken with[7862] strychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours.”[7863] [13]
[7864] Poirot paused. Mary looked up at him, the colour slowly rising in her[7865] face.[7866] [13]
[7867] “All you have said is quite true, Monsieur Poirot. It was the most[7868] awful hour of my life. I shall never forget it. But you are wonderful.[7869] I understand now——”[7870] [13]
[7871] “What I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa[7872] Poirot, eh? But you would not trust me.”[7873] [13]
[7874] “I see everything now,” said Lawrence. “The drugged cocoa, taken on top[7875] of the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay.”[7876] [13]
[7877] “Exactly. But was the coffee poisoned, or was it not? We come to a[7878] little difficulty here, since Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it.”[7879] [13]
[7880] “What?” The cry of surprise was universal.[7881] [13]
[7882] “No. You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in Mrs.[7883] Inglethorp’s room? There were some peculiar points about that stain. It[7884] was still damp, it exhaled a strong odour of coffee, and imbedded in[7885] the nap of the carpet I found some little splinters of china. What had[7886] happened was plain to me, for not two minutes before I had placed my[7887] little case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up,[7888] had deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot. In[7889] exactly the same way, Mrs. Inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee[7890] on reaching her room the night before, and the treacherous table had[7891] played her the same trick.[7892] [13]
[7893] “What happened next is mere guess work on my part, but I should say[7894] that Mrs. Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the[7895] table by the bed. Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she[7896] heated up her cocoa, and drank it off then and there. Now we are faced[7897] with a new problem. We know the cocoa contained no strychnine. The[7898] coffee was never drunk. Yet the strychnine must have been administered[7899] between seven and nine o’clock that evening. What third medium was[7900] there—a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that[7901] it is extraordinary no one has thought of it?” Poirot looked round the[7902] room, and then answered himself impressively. “Her medicine!”[7903] [13]
[7904] “Do you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her[7905] tonic?” I cried.[7906] [13]
[7907] “There was no need to introduce it. It was already there—in the[7908] mixture. The strychnine that killed Mrs. Inglethorp was the identical[7909] strychnine prescribed by Dr. Wilkins. To make that clear to you, I will[7910] read you an extract from a book on dispensing which I found in the[7911] Dispensary of the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster:[7912] [13]
[7913] “‘The following prescription has become famous in text books:[7914] [13]
[7915] [13]
[7916]           Strychninae Sulph. . . . . . 1 gr.[7917] [13]
[7918]           Potass Bromide . . . . . . . 3vi[7919] [13]
[7920]           Aqua ad. . . . . . . . . . . . . 3viii[7921] [13]
[7922]           Fiat Mistura[7923] [13]
[7924] [13]
[7925] _This solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the[7926] strychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals. A lady[7927] in England lost her life by taking a similar mixture: the precipitated[7928] strychnine collected at the bottom, and in taking the last dose she[7929] swallowed nearly all of it!_[7930] [13]
[7931] “Now there was, of course, no bromide in Dr. Wilkins’ prescription, but[7932] you will remember that I mentioned an empty box of bromide powders. One[7933] or two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine[7934] would effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes,[7935] and cause it to be taken in the last dose. You will learn later that[7936] the person who usually poured out Mrs. Inglethorp’s medicine was always[7937] extremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at[7938] the bottom of it undisturbed.[7939] [13]
[7940] “Throughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was[7941] intended to take place on Monday evening. On that day, Mrs.[7942] Inglethorp’s bell wire was neatly cut, and on Monday evening[7943] Mademoiselle Cynthia was spending the night with friends, so that Mrs.[7944] Inglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing, completely[7945] shut off from help of any kind, and would have died, in all[7946] probability, before medical aid could have been summoned. But in her[7947] hurry to be in time for the village entertainment Mrs. Inglethorp[7948] forgot to take her medicine, and the next day she lunched away from[7949] home, so that the last—and fatal—dose was actually taken twenty-four[7950] hours later than had been anticipated by the murderer; and it is owing[7951] to that delay that the final proof—the last link of the chain—is now in[7952] my hands.”[7953] [13]
[7954] Amid breathless excitement, he held out three thin strips of paper.[7955] [13]
[7956] “A letter in the murderer’s own hand-writing, _mes amis!_ Had it been a[7957] little clearer in its terms, it is possible that Mrs. Inglethorp,[7958] warned in time, would have escaped. As it was, she realized her danger,[7959] but not the manner of it.”[7960] [13]
[7961] In the deathly silence, Poirot pieced together the slips of paper and,[7962] clearing his throat, read:[7963] [13]
[7964] Dearest Evelyn:[7965] [13]
[7966]     ‘You will be anxious at hearing nothing. It is all right—only it[7967]     will be to-night instead of last night. You understand. There’s a[7968]     good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way. No[7969]     one can possibly bring home the crime to me. That idea of yours[7970]     about the bromides was a stroke of genius! But we must be very[7971]     circumspect. A false step——’[7972] [13]
[7973] [13]
[7974] “Here, my friends, the letter breaks off. Doubtless the writer was[7975] interrupted; but there can be no question as to his identity. We all[7976] know this hand-writing and——”[7977] [13]
[7978] A howl that was almost a scream broke the silence.[7979] [13]
[7980] “You devil! How did you get it?”[7981] [13]
[7982] A chair was overturned. Poirot skipped nimbly aside. A quick movement[7983] on his part, and his assailant fell with a crash.[7984] [13]
[7985] “_Messieurs, mesdames_,” said Poirot, with a flourish, “let me[7986] introduce you to the murderer, Mr. Alfred Inglethorp!”[7987] [13]
[7988] [13]
[7989] [13]
[7990] [13]
[7991] CHAPTER XIII.[7992] POIROT EXPLAINS[7993] [13]
[7994] [13]
[7995] “Poirot, you old villain,” I said, “I’ve half a mind to strangle you![7996] What do you mean by deceiving me as you have done?”[7997] [13]
[7998] We were sitting in the library. Several hectic days lay behind us. In[7999] the room below, John and Mary were together once more, while Alfred[8000] Inglethorp and Miss Howard were in custody. Now at last, I had Poirot[8001] to myself, and could relieve my still burning curiosity.[8002] [13]
[8003] Poirot did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said:[8004] [13]
[8005] “I did not deceive you, _mon ami_. At most, I permitted you to deceive[8006] yourself.”[8007] [13]
[8008] “Yes, but why?”[8009] [13]
[8010] “Well, it is difficult to explain. You see, my friend, you have a[8011] nature so honest, and a countenance so transparent, that—_enfin_, to[8012] conceal your feelings is impossible! If I had told you my ideas, the[8013] very first time you saw Mr. Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman[8014] would have—in your so expressive idiom—‘smelt a rat’! And then,[8015] _bonjour_ to our chances of catching him!”[8016] [13]
[8017] “I think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit for.”[8018] [13]
[8019] “My friend,” besought Poirot, “I implore you, do not enrage yourself![8020] Your help has been of the most invaluable. It is but the extremely[8021] beautiful nature that you have, which made me pause.”[8022] [13]
[8023] “Well,” I grumbled, a little mollified. “I still think you might have[8024] given me a hint.”[8025] [13]
[8026] “But I did, my friend. Several hints. You would not take them. Think[8027] now, did I ever say to you that I believed John Cavendish guilty? Did I[8028] not, on the contrary, tell you that he would almost certainly be[8029] acquitted?”[8030] [13]
[8031] “Yes, but——”[8032] [13]
[8033] “And did I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of[8034] bringing the murderer to justice? Was it not plain to you that I was[8035] speaking of two entirely different persons?”[8036] [13]
[8037] “No,” I said, “it was not plain to me!”[8038] [13]
[8039] “Then again,” continued Poirot, “at the beginning, did I not repeat to[8040] you several times that I didn’t want Mr. Inglethorp arrested _now_?[8041] That should have conveyed something to you.”[8042] [13]
[8043] “Do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that?”[8044] [13]
[8045] “Yes. To begin with, whoever else might benefit by Mrs. Inglethorp’s[8046] death, her husband would benefit the most. There was no getting away[8047] from that. When I went up to Styles with you that first day, I had no[8048] idea as to how the crime had been committed, but from what I knew of[8049] Mr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to[8050] connect him with it. When I arrived at the château, I realized at once[8051] that it was Mrs. Inglethorp who had burnt the will; and there, by the[8052] way, you cannot complain, my friend, for I tried my best to force on[8053] you the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer.”[8054] [13]
[8055] “Yes, yes,” I said impatiently. “Go on.”[8056] [13]
[8057] “Well, my friend, as I say, my views as to Mr. Inglethorp’s guilt were[8058] very much shaken. There was, in fact, so much evidence against him that[8059] I was inclined to believe that he had not done it.”[8060] [13]
[8061] “When did you change your mind?”[8062] [13]
[8063] “When I found that the more efforts I made to clear him, the more[8064] efforts he made to get himself arrested. Then, when I discovered that[8065] Inglethorp had nothing to do with Mrs. Raikes and that in fact it was[8066] John Cavendish who was interested in that quarter, I was quite sure.”[8067] [13]
[8068] “But why?”[8069] [13]
[8070] “Simply this. If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue[8071] with Mrs. Raikes, his silence was perfectly comprehensible. But, when I[8072] discovered that it was known all over the village that it was John who[8073] was attracted by the farmer’s pretty wife, his silence bore quite a[8074] different interpretation. It was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid[8075] of the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him. This[8076] attitude of his gave me furiously to think, and I was slowly forced to[8077] the conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested. _Eh bien!_[8078] from that moment, I was equally determined that he should not be[8079] arrested.”[8080] [13]
[8081] “Wait a minute. I don’t see why he wished to be arrested?”[8082] [13]
[8083] “Because, _mon ami_, it is the law of your country that a man once[8084] acquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. Aha! but it[8085] was clever—his idea! Assuredly, he is a man of method. See here, he[8086] knew that in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he conceived[8087] the exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence[8088] against himself. He wished to be arrested. He would then produce his[8089] irreproachable alibi—and, hey presto, he was safe for life!”[8090] [13]
[8091] “But I still don’t see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to[8092] the chemist’s shop?”[8093] [13]
[8094] Poirot stared at me in surprise.[8095] [13]
[8096] “Is it possible? My poor friend! You have not yet realized that it was[8097] Miss Howard who went to the chemist’s shop?”[8098] [13]
[8099] “Miss Howard?”[8100] [13]
[8101] “But, certainly. Who else? It was most easy for her. She is of a good[8102] height, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and[8103] Inglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between[8104] them, especially in their gait and bearing. It was simplicity itself.[8105] They are a clever pair!”[8106] [13]
[8107] “I am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was[8108] done,” I remarked.[8109] [13]
[8110] “_Bon!_ I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am inclined to[8111] think that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair. You remember[8112] her once mentioning that her father was a doctor? Possibly she[8113] dispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from[8114] one of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was[8115] studying for her exam. Anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the[8116] addition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause[8117] the precipitation of the latter. Probably the idea came to her quite[8118] suddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she[8119] occasionally took at night. What could be easier than quietly to[8120] dissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorp’s large sized[8121] bottle of medicine when it came from Coot’s? The risk is practically[8122] nil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If[8123] anyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have[8124] forgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her[8125] quarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her[8126] absence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they[8127] had left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been[8128] brought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too[8129] clever—and that was their undoing.”[8130] [13]
[8131] Poirot puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.[8132] [13]
[8133] “They arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish, by buying[8134] strychnine at the village chemist’s, and signing the register in his[8135] hand-writing.[8136] [13]
[8137] “On Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine. On[8138] Monday, therefore, at six o’clock, Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be[8139] seen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. Miss[8140] Howard has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs.[8141] Raikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards. At six[8142] o’clock, Miss Howard, disguised as Alfred Inglethorp, enters the[8143] chemist’s shop, with her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and[8144] writes the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John’s handwriting, which she[8145] had previously studied carefully.[8146] [13]
[8147] “But, as it will never do if John, too, can prove an alibi, she writes[8148] him an anonymous note—still copying his hand-writing—which takes him to[8149] a remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see[8150] him.[8151] [13]
[8152] “So far, all goes well. Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham. Alfred[8153] Inglethorp returns to Styles. There is nothing that can compromise him[8154] in any way, since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine, which,[8155] after all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John[8156] Cavendish.[8157] [13]
[8158] “But now a hitch occurs. Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine[8159] that night. The broken bell, Cynthia’s absence—arranged by Inglethorp[8160] through his wife—all these are wasted. And then—he makes his slip.[8161] [13]
[8162] “Mrs. Inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice,[8163] who, he fears, may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan. It[8164] is probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he expected.[8165] Caught in the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his[8166] desk. He fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it[8167] again, and that Mrs. Inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before[8168] he could snatch it up. So he goes out and walks in the woods, little[8169] dreaming that Mrs. Inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the[8170] incriminating document.[8171] [13]
[8172] “But this, as we know, is what happened. Mrs. Inglethorp reads it, and[8173] becomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn Howard, though,[8174] unfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to[8175] her mind. She knows that she is in danger—but is ignorant of where the[8176] danger lies. She decides to say nothing to her husband, but sits down[8177] and writes to her solicitor, asking him to come on the morrow, and she[8178] also determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just[8179] made. She keeps the fatal letter.”[8180] [13]
[8181] “It was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced the lock[8182] of the despatch-case?”[8183] [13]
[8184] “Yes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he[8185] realized its importance. That letter excepted, there was absolutely[8186] nothing to connect him with the crime.”[8187] [13]
[8188] “There’s only one thing I can’t make out, why didn’t he destroy it at[8189] once when he got hold of it?”[8190] [13]
[8191] “Because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all—that of keeping[8192] it on his own person.”[8193] [13]
[8194] “I don’t understand.”[8195] [13]
[8196] “Look at it from his point of view. I have discovered that there were[8197] only five short minutes in which he could have taken it—the five[8198] minutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before[8199] that time Annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who[8200] passed going to the right wing. Figure to yourself the scene! He enters[8201] the room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys—they[8202] were all much alike. He hurries to the despatch-case—it is locked, and[8203] the keys are nowhere to be seen. That is a terrible blow to him, for it[8204] means that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had[8205] hoped. But he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake[8206] of that damning piece of evidence. Quickly, he forces the lock with a[8207] penknife, and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking[8208] for.[8209] [13]
[8210] “But now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of paper[8211] on him. He may be seen leaving the room—he may be searched. If the[8212] paper is found on him, it is certain doom. Probably, at this minute,[8213] too, he hears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John leaving the[8214] boudoir. He must act quickly. Where can he hide this terrible slip of[8215] paper? The contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case,[8216] are sure to be examined. There are no means of destroying it; and he[8217] dare not keep it. He looks round, and he sees—what do you think, _mon[8218] ami?_”[8219] [13]
[8220] I shook my head.[8221] [13]
[8222] “In a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling[8223] them up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other[8224] spills in the vase on the mantle-piece.”[8225] [13]
[8226] I uttered an exclamation.[8227] [13]
[8228] “No one would think of looking there,” Poirot continued. “And he will[8229] be able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece[8230] of evidence against him.”[8231] [13]
[8232] “Then, all the time, it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp’s[8233] bedroom, under our very noses?” I cried.[8234] [13]
[8235] Poirot nodded.[8236] [13]
[8237] “Yes, my friend. That is where I discovered my ‘last link,’ and I owe[8238] that very fortunate discovery to you.”[8239] [13]
[8240] “To me?”[8241] [13]
[8242] “Yes. Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was[8243] straightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece?”[8244] [13]
[8245] “Yes, but I don’t see——”[8246] [13]
[8247] “No, but I saw. Do you know, my friend, I remembered that earlier in[8248] the morning, when we had been there together, I had straightened all[8249] the objects on the mantelpiece. And, if they were already straightened,[8250] there would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the[8251] meantime, someone else had touched them.”[8252] [13]
[8253] “Dear me,” I murmured, “so that is the explanation of your[8254] extraordinary behaviour. You rushed down to Styles, and found it still[8255] there?”[8256] [13]
[8257] “Yes, and it was a race for time.”[8258] [13]
[8259] “But I still can’t understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to[8260] leave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.”[8261] [13]
[8262] “Ah, but he had no opportunity. _I_ saw to that.”[8263] [13]
[8264] “You?”[8265] [13]
[8266] “Yes. Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my[8267] confidence on the subject?”[8268] [13]
[8269] “Yes.”[8270] [13]
[8271] “Well, my friend, I saw there was just one chance. I was not sure then[8272] if Inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was I reasoned that he[8273] would not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere,[8274] and by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually[8275] prevent his destroying it. He was already under suspicion, and by[8276] making the matter public I secured the services of about ten amateur[8277] detectives, who would be watching him unceasingly, and being himself[8278] aware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy[8279] the document. He was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving[8280] it in the spill vase.”[8281] [13]
[8282] “But surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding him.”[8283] [13]
[8284] “Yes, but Miss Howard did not know of the paper’s existence. In[8285] accordance with their prearranged plan, she never spoke to Alfred[8286] Inglethorp. They were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until John[8287] Cavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a[8288] meeting. Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp, hoping that[8289] sooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place. But he was too[8290] clever to take any chances. The paper was safe where it was; since no[8291] one had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely[8292] they would do so afterwards. But for your lucky remark, we might never[8293] have been able to bring him to justice.”[8294] [13]
[8295] “I understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect Miss[8296] Howard?”[8297] [13]
[8298] “When I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the[8299] letter she had received from Mrs. Inglethorp.”[8300] [13]
[8301] “Why, what was there to lie about?”[8302] [13]
[8303] “You saw that letter? Do you recall its general appearance?”[8304] [13]
[8305] “Yes—more or less.”[8306] [13]
[8307] “You will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very[8308] distinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words. But if[8309] you look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that[8310] ‘July 17th’ is quite different in this respect. Do you see what I[8311] mean?”[8312] [13]
[8313] “No,” I confessed, “I don’t.”[8314] [13]
[8315] “You do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on[8316] the 7th—the day after Miss Howard’s departure? The ‘1’ was written in[8317] before the ‘7’ to turn it into the ‘17th’.”[8318] [13]
[8319] “But why?”[8320] [13]
[8321] “That is exactly what I asked myself. Why does Miss Howard suppress the[8322] letter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead? Because[8323] she did not wish to show the letter of the 17th. Why, again? And at[8324] once a suspicion dawned in my mind. You will remember my saying that it[8325] was wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.”[8326] [13]
[8327] “And yet,” I cried indignantly, “after that, you gave me two reasons[8328] why Miss Howard could not have committed the crime!”[8329] [13]
[8330] “And very good reasons too,” replied Poirot. “For a long time they were[8331] a stumbling-block to me until I remembered a very significant fact:[8332] that she and Alfred Inglethorp were cousins. She could not have[8333] committed the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not[8334] debar her from being an accomplice. And, then, there was that rather[8335] over-vehement hatred of hers! It concealed a very opposite emotion.[8336] There was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he[8337] came to Styles. They had already arranged their infamous plot—that he[8338] should marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make[8339] a will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very[8340] cleverly conceived crime. If all had gone as they planned, they would[8341] probably have left England, and lived together on their poor victim’s[8342] money.[8343] [13]
[8344] “They are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. While suspicion was to[8345] be directed against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a[8346] very different _dénouement_. She arrives from Middlingham with all the[8347] compromising items in her possession. No suspicion attaches to her. No[8348] notice is paid to her coming and going in the house. She hides the[8349] strychnine and glasses in John’s room. She puts the beard in the attic.[8350] She will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered.”[8351] [13]
[8352] “I don’t quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John,” I[8353] remarked. “It would have been much easier for them to bring the crime[8354] home to Lawrence.”[8355] [13]
[8356] “Yes, but that was mere chance. All the evidence against him arose out[8357] of pure accident. It must, in fact, have been distinctly annoying to[8358] the pair of schemers.”[8359] [13]
[8360] “His manner was unfortunate,” I observed thoughtfully.[8361] [13]
[8362] “Yes. You realize, of course, what was at the back of that?”[8363] [13]
[8364] “No.”[8365] [13]
[8366] “You did not understand that he believed Mademoiselle Cynthia guilty of[8367] the crime?”[8368] [13]
[8369] “No,” I exclaimed, astonished. “Impossible!”[8370] [13]
[8371] “Not at all. I myself nearly had the same idea. It was in my mind when[8372] I asked Mr. Wells that first question about the will. Then there were[8373] the bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male[8374] impersonations, as Dorcas recounted them to us. There was really more[8375] evidence against her than anyone else.”[8376] [13]
[8377] “You are joking, Poirot!”[8378] [13]
[8379] “No. Shall I tell you what made Monsieur Lawrence turn so pale when he[8380] first entered his mother’s room on the fatal night? It was because,[8381] whilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw, over your[8382] shoulder, that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthia’s room was unbolted.”[8383] [13]
[8384] “But he declared that he saw it bolted!” I cried.[8385] [13]
[8386] “Exactly,” said Poirot dryly. “And that was just what confirmed my[8387] suspicion that it was not. He was shielding Mademoiselle Cynthia.”[8388] [13]
[8389] “But why should he shield her?”[8390] [13]
[8391] “Because he is in love with her.”[8392] [13]
[8393] I laughed.[8394] [13]
[8395] “There, Poirot, you are quite wrong! I happen to know for a fact that,[8396] far from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her.”[8397] [13]
[8398] “Who told you that, _mon ami?_”[8399] [13]
[8400] “Cynthia herself.”[8401] [13]
[8402] “_La pauvre petite!_ And she was concerned?”[8403] [13]
[8404] “She said that she did not mind at all.”[8405] [13]
[8406] “Then she certainly did mind very much,” remarked Poirot. “They are[8407] like that—_les femmes!_”[8408] [13]
[8409] “What you say about Lawrence is a great surprise to me,” I said.[8410] [13]
[8411] “But why? It was most obvious. Did not Monsieur Lawrence make the sour[8412] face every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed with his[8413] brother? He had taken it into his long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia[8414] was in love with Monsieur John. When he entered his mother’s room, and[8415] saw her obviously poisoned, he jumped to the conclusion that[8416] Mademoiselle Cynthia knew something about the matter. He was nearly[8417] driven desperate. First he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his[8418] feet, remembering that _she_ had gone up with his mother the night[8419] before, and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its[8420] contents. Thenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld[8421] the theory of ‘Death from natural causes’.”[8422] [13]
[8423] “And what about the ‘extra coffee-cup’?”[8424] [13]
[8425] “I was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden it, but[8426] I had to make sure. Monsieur Lawrence did not know at all what I meant;[8427] but, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if he could find an[8428] extra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion.[8429] And he was perfectly right.”[8430] [13]
[8431] “One thing more. What did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying words?”[8432] [13]
[8433] “They were, of course, an accusation against her husband.”[8434] [13]
[8435] “Dear me, Poirot,” I said with a sigh, “I think you have explained[8436] everything. I am glad it has all ended so happily. Even John and his[8437] wife are reconciled.”[8438] [13]
[8439] “Thanks to me.”[8440] [13]
[8441] “How do you mean—thanks to you?”[8442] [13]
[8443] “My dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the[8444] trial which has brought them together again? That John Cavendish still[8445] loved his wife, I was convinced. Also, that she was equally in love[8446] with him. But they had drifted very far apart. It all arose from a[8447] misunderstanding. She married him without love. He knew it. He is a[8448] sensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she[8449] did not want him. And, as he withdrew, her love awoke. But they are[8450] both unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart. He[8451] drifted into an entanglement with Mrs. Raikes, and she deliberately[8452] cultivated the friendship of Dr. Bauerstein. Do you remember the day of[8453] John Cavendish’s arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big[8454] decision?”[8455] [13]
[8456] “Yes, I quite understood your distress.”[8457] [13]
[8458] “Pardon me, _mon ami_, but you did not understand it in the least. I[8459] was trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at[8460] once. I could have cleared him—though it might have meant a failure to[8461] convict the real criminals. They were entirely in the dark as to my[8462] real attitude up to the very last moment—which partly accounts for my[8463] success.”[8464] [13]
[8465] “Do you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being[8466] brought to trial?”[8467] [13]
[8468] “Yes, my friend. But I eventually decided in favour of ‘a woman’s[8469] happiness’. Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed[8470] could have brought these two proud souls together again.”[8471] [13]
[8472] I looked at Poirot in silent amazement. The colossal cheek of the[8473] little man! Who on earth but Poirot would have thought of a trial for[8474] murder as a restorer of conjugal happiness![8475] [13]
[8476] “I perceive your thoughts, _mon ami_,” said Poirot, smiling at me. “No[8477] one but Hercule Poirot would have attempted such a thing! And you are[8478] wrong in condemning it. The happiness of one man and one woman is the[8479] greatest thing in all the world.”[8480] [13]
[8481] His words took me back to earlier events. I remembered Mary as she lay[8482] white and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening. There had come[8483] the sound of the bell below. She had started up. Poirot had opened the[8484] door, and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently. “Yes, madame,”[8485] he said. “I have brought him back to you.” He had stood aside, and as I[8486] went out I had seen the look in Mary’s eyes, as John Cavendish had[8487] caught his wife in his arms.[8488] [13]
[8489] “Perhaps you are right, Poirot,” I said gently. “Yes, it is the[8490] greatest thing in the world.”[8491] [13]
[8492] Suddenly, there was a tap at the door, and Cynthia peeped in.[8493] [13]
[8494] “I—I only——”[8495] [13]
[8496] “Come in,” I said, springing up.[8497] [13]
[8498] She came in, but did not sit down.[8499] [13]
[8500] “I—only wanted to tell you something——”[8501] [13]
[8502] “Yes?”[8503] [13]
[8504] Cynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then, suddenly[8505] exclaiming: “You dears!” kissed first me and then Poirot, and rushed[8506] out of the room again.[8507] [13]
[8508] “What on earth does this mean?” I asked, surprised.[8509] [13]
[8510] It was very nice to be kissed by Cynthia, but the publicity of the[8511] salute rather impaired the pleasure.[8512] [13]
[8513] “It means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike[8514] her as much as she thought,” replied Poirot philosophically.[8515] [13]
[8516] “But——”[8517] [13]
[8518] “Here he is.”[8519] [13]
[8520] Lawrence at that moment passed the door.[8521] [13]
[8522] “Eh! Monsieur Lawrence,” called Poirot. “We must congratulate you, is[8523] it not so?”[8524] [13]
[8525] Lawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. A man in love is a sorry[8526] spectacle. Now Cynthia had looked charming.[8527] [13]
[8528] I sighed.[8529] [13]
[8530] “What is it, _mon ami?_”[8531] [13]
[8532] “Nothing,” I said sadly. “They are two delightful women!”[8533] [13]
[8534] “And neither of them is for you?” finished Poirot. “Never mind. Console[8535] yourself, my friend. We may hunt together again, who knows? And then——”[8536] [13]
[8537] [13]
[8538] THE END[8539] [13]

[8594] 1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be[8595] used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who[8596] agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few[8597] things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works[8598] even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See[8599] paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project[8600] Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this[8601] agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm[8602] electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.[8603] [13]
[8604] 1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the[8605] Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection[8606] of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual[8607] works in the collection are in the public domain in the United[8608] States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the[8609] United States and you are located in the United States, we do not[8610] claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,[8611] displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as[8612] all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope[8613] that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting[8614] free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm[8615] works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the[8616] Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily[8617] comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the[8618] same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when[8619] you share it without charge with others.[8620] [13]
[8621] 1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern[8622] what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are[8623] in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,[8624] check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this[8625] agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,[8626] distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any[8627] other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no[8628] representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any[8629] country other than the United States.[8630] [13]
[8631] 1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:[8632] [13]
[8633] 1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other[8634] immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear[8635] prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work[8636] on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the[8637] phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,[8638] performed, viewed, copied or distributed:[8639] [13]
[8640]   This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and[8641]   most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no[8642]   restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it[8643]   under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this[8644]   eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the[8645]   United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where[8646]   you are located before using this eBook.[8647] [13]
[8648] 1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is[8649] derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not[8650] contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the[8651] copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in[8652] the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are[8653] redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project[8654] Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply[8655] either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or[8656] obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm[8657] trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.[8658] [13]
[8659] 1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted[8660] with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution[8661] must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any[8662] additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms[8663] will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works[8664] posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the[8665] beginning of this work.[8666] [13]
[8667] 1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm[8668] License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this[8669] work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.[8670] [13]
[8671] 1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this[8672] electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without[8673] prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with[8674] active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project[8675] Gutenberg-tm License.[8676] [13]
[8677] 1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,[8678] compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including[8679] any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access[8680] to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format[8681] other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official[8682] version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website[8683] (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense[8684] to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means[8685] of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain[8686] Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the[8687] full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.[8688] [13]
[8689] 1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,[8690] performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works[8691] unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.[8692] [13]
[8693] 1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing[8694] access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works[8695] provided that:[8696] [13]
[8697] * You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from[8698]   the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method[8699]   you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed[8700]   to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has[8701]   agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project[8702]   Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid[8703]   within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are[8704]   legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty[8705]   payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project[8706]   Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in[8707]   Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg[8708]   Literary Archive Foundation."[8709] [13]
[8710] * You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies[8711]   you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he[8712]   does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm[8713]   License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all[8714]   copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue[8715]   all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm[8716]   works.[8717] [13]
[8718] * You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of[8719]   any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the[8720]   electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of[8721]   receipt of the work.[8722] [13]
[8723] * You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free[8724]   distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.[8725] [13]
[8726] 1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project[8727] Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than[8728] are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing[8729] from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of[8730] the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set[8731] forth in Section 3 below.[8732] [13]
[8733] 1.F.[8734] [13]
[8735] 1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable[8736] effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread[8737] works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project[8738] Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm[8739] electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may[8740] contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate[8741] or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other[8742] intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or[8743] other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or[8744] cannot be read by your equipment.[8745] [13]
[8746] 1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right[8747] of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project[8748] Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project[8749] Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project[8750] Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all[8751] liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal[8752] fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT[8753] LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE[8754] PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE[8755] TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE[8756] LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR[8757] INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH[8758] DAMAGE.[8759] [13]
[8760] 1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a[8761] defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can[8762] receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a[8763] written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you[8764] received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium[8765] with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you[8766] with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in[8767] lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person[8768] or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second[8769] opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If[8770] the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing[8771] without further opportunities to fix the problem.[8772] [13]
[8773] 1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth[8774] in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO[8775] OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT[8776] LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.[8777] [13]
[8778] 1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied[8779] warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of[8780] damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement[8781] violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the[8782] agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or[8783] limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or[8784] unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the[8785] remaining provisions.[8786] [13]
[8787] 1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the[8788] trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone[8789] providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in[8790] accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the[8791] production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm[8792] electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,[8793] including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of[8794] the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this[8795] or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or[8796] additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any[8797] Defect you cause.[8798] [13]
[8799] Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm[8800] [13]
[8801] Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of[8802] electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of[8803] computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It[8804] exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations[8805] from people in all walks of life.[8806] [13]
[8807] Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the[8808] assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's[8809] goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will[8810] remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project[8811] Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure[8812] and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future[8813] generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary[8814] Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see[8815] Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at[8816] www.gutenberg.org[8817] [13]
[8818] Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary[8819] Archive Foundation[8820] [13]
[8821] The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit[8822] 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the[8823] state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal[8824] Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification[8825] number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary[8826] Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by[8827] U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.[8828] [13]
[8829] The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,[8830] Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up[8831] to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website[8832] and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact[8833] [13]
[8834] Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg[8835] Literary Archive Foundation[8836] [13]
[8837] Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without[8838] widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of[8839] increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be[8840] freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest[8841] array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations[8842] ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt[8843] status with the IRS.[8844] [13]
[8845] The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating[8846] charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United[8847] States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a[8848] considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up[8849] with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations[8850] where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND[8851] DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular[8852] state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate[8853] [13]
[8854] While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we[8855] have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition[8856] against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who[8857] approach us with offers to donate.[8858] [13]
[8859] International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make[8860] any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from[8861] outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.[8862] [13]
[8863] Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation[8864] methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other[8865] ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To[8866] donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate[8867] [13]
[8868] Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works[8869] [13]
[8870] Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project[8871] Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be[8872] freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and[8873] distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of[8874] volunteer support.[8875] [13]
[8876] Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed[8877] editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in[8878] the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not[8879] necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper[8880] edition.[8881] [13]
[8882] Most people start at our website which has the main PG search[8883] facility: www.gutenberg.org[8884] [13]
[8885] This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,[8886] including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary[8887] Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to[8888] subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.[8889] [13]
